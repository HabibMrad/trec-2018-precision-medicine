Conventional systemic chemotherapy has limited efficacy and novel therapeutic strategies are needed to achieve better outcomes for patients. The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) gene is highly amplified in more than 95% of WD\\/DDLPS. In this study, we explored the role of CDK4 and the effects of NVP-LEE011 (LEE011), a novel selective inhibitor of CDK4\\/CDK6, on a panel of human liposarcoma cell lines and primary tumor xenografts. We found that both CDK4 knockdown by siRNA and inhibition by LEE011 diminished retinoblastoma (RB) phosphorylation and dramatically decreased liposarcoma cell growth. Cell-cycle analysis demonstrated arrest at G0-G1. siRNA-mediated knockdown of RB rescued the inhibitory effects of LEE011, demonstrating that LEE011 decreased proliferation through RB. Oral administration of LEE011 to mice bearing human liposarcoma xenografts resulted in approximately 50% reduction in tumor (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake with decreased tumor biomarkers, including RB phosphorylation and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in vivo. Continued treatment inhibited tumor growth or induced regression without detrimental effects on mouse weight. After prolonged continuous dosing, reestablishment of RB phosphorylation and cell-cycle progression was noted. These findings validate the critical role of CDK4 in maintaining liposarcoma proliferation through its ability to inactivate RB function, and suggest its potential function in the regulation of survival and metabolism of liposarcoma, supporting the rationale for clinical development of LEE011 for the treatment of WD\\/DDLPS.",

This make-up appears to be confined to half the cases in non-retroperitoneal well-differentiated liposarcomas. Since in different tumours MDM2 amplification involves amplicons encompassing flanking genes, such as CDK4, the possibility was investigated that in these tumours, CDK4 could act as an alternative or additional gene involved in the transformation mechanism. Forty-one retroperitoneal (R)\\/non-retroperitoneal (NR) well-differentiated-dedifferentiated (WD-DD) and 33 myxoid\\/round cell liposarcomas were reanalysed by immunocytochemical, molecular (nine cases) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (one case) techniques. The results showed that all but one R WD-E cases carried the mdm2+, p53+, cdk4+ immunophenotype. In NR-WD liposarcomas, this immunophenotype was shared in five cases and the remainder showed mdm2+, p53-, cdk4+ in four and mdm2-, p53-, cdk4+ in one case, showing ring chromosomes by FISH analysis. TP53 mutations are confirmed to be closely correlated with NR-DD liposarcomas and no CDK4 involvement was found in the myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma group. As well as confirming the synergistic effect of MDM2 and CDK4, these results are consistent with the concept that amplicon(s) excluding MDM2 may contribute to transformation and support a role of CDK4 in opposing p53 function, particularly in NR WD liposarcoma.",

To our knowledge, only 43 cases of liposarcoma originating in the oral tissues have been reported in the English-language literature. In this article, we report a case of well-differentiated liposarcoma affecting the cheek of a 28-year-old man and review the oral liposarcoma literature. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor revealed an MDM2+\\/CDK4+\\/p53+ immunophenotype that is consistent with the immunohistochemical profile of well-differentiated liposarcoma originating in other areas of the body. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of the DNA levels of the MDM2 (human homologue of the murine double-minute type 2), CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4), and SAS (sarcoma amplified sequence), genes was performed, revealing only SAS gene amplification. The possibility of misdiagnosis of oral liposarcoma because of its sometimes inconspicuous clinical and microscopic features is emphasized. Careful pathologic examination of liposarcoma is essential for discrimination from benign adipose tissue neoplasms and for precise histologic classification, both of major prognostic significance. Possible implications of molecular and cytogenetic analysis for unraveling the pathogenesis and determining the prognosis of liposarcoma are discussed.",

While liposarcoma classification in dogs is based solely on histology, in humans it depends on the detection of genetic abnormalities that can lead to specific protein overexpression. This study is an immunohistochemical evaluation of MDM2 and CDK4 expression in canine liposarcoma designed to assess the correlation of these proteins with histologic type, grade, mitotic index and Ki67 labeling index and evaluate their utility in improving tumor classification. Fifty-three liposarcomas were retrospectively collected: 24 were well differentiated liposarcomas (WDL), 16 of which expressed MDM2 and 21 CDK4; 7 were myxoid liposarcomas (ML), 1 of which expressed MDM2 and 5 expressed CDK4; 18 were pleomorphic liposarcomas (PL), all were MDM2 negative and 12 expressed CDK4. Four tumors were morphologically consistent with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL) a subtype described only in humans: 3 expressed MDM2 and 4 expressed CDK4. MDM2 expression correlated with histotype (highly expressed in WDL and DDL) and grade (highly expressed in grade 1 tumors). Histotype correlated with the Ki67 labeling index (lowest in WDL and highest in DDL). A revised classification, considering MDM2 expression, allowed 8 WDL to be reclassified as PL and correlated significantly with mitotic and Ki67 labeling index (both significantly lower in WDL and progressively higher in ML and DDL). These results partially parallel data reported for human liposarcomas, suggesting that WDL and DDL are distinct neoplastic entities characterized by MDM2 expression, which may represent a useful diagnostic and potentially prognostic marker for canine liposarcoma.",

These amplicons are either localized, in well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS), on extrachromosomal structures (ring or rod chromosomes), or integrated into chromosome arms in undifferentiated tumors. Our results reveal that extrachromosomal amplicons are unstable, and frequently lost by micronucleation. This loss correlates with hypermethylation of eliminated sequences and changes of their replication time. Treatment of cells with demethylating agents during early S-phase significantly decreases the rate of micronuclei positive for CDK4. We also demonstrate that, in our model, micronuclei are generated during anaphase as a consequence of anaphase abnormalities (chromosome lagging and anaphase bridges). Finally, a dramatic increase of adipocytic differentiation was noted in cells that have eliminated copies of CDK4 gene in micronuclei. These findings provide evidence that, in WDLPS, adipocytic differentiation could be the consequence of CDK4 loss, an event occurring rarely in undifferentiated tumors in which the amplified sequences are integrated into chromosome arms.",

However, 15 cases of entirely dermal PL have been reported. We describe a case of a 79-year-old man who developed a rapidly growing nodule on his thorax. Excisional biopsy was performed and immunohistochemical studies were carried. The lesion was a well-circumscribed dermal nodule composed of multivacuolated pleomorphic lipoblasts and atypical mitotic figures. Neoplastic cells expressed CD10 and resulted negative S100 protein, Melan-A, MITF-1, AE1\\/AE3, CD4, CD68 (PGM1), retinoblastoma gene family protein, pericentrine and lysozyme. Adipophilin stain showed the lipid contents in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells. MDM2 and CDK4 resulted both negative. A diagnosis of primary dermal PL was made. This case shows the utility of adipophilin immunostaining to prove the lipid contents in neoplastic cells, which has the advantage of using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and making needless frozen sections and ultrastructural studies to show these findings. Negative MDM2\\/CDK4 staining in our case argues against the possibility of dedifferentiated liposarcoma and further supports the diagnosis of true PL.",

Although the diagnostic usefulness of this molecular characteristic in liposarcomas has been investigated, its prognostic utility of quantitative gene level has not been explored. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of level of CDK4 amplification in MDM2-amplified WDLS\\/DDLS. MDM2 amplification in liposarcomas was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The copy number of MDM2 and CDK4 was further determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Among 56 MDM2-amplified liposarcomas, 30 cases were assigned as WDLS, and 26 as DDLS. When liposarcomas were classified by qPCR-determined CDK4 amplification levels, the high-CDK4 group showed significantly poorer progression free survival (P=0.001) and disease specific survival (P=0.033) than the low-CDK4 group. However, MDM2 amplification level did not show prognostic significance. In WDLS\\/DDLS, the level of CDK4 amplification was useful for prognosis prediction and precise stratification of patients for targeted therapy.",

The specimens were from the retroperitoneum (3), pelvis (1) or paratesticular region (1), and all 5 specimens comprised exclusively or predominantly dedifferentiated liposarcoma. All 5 dedifferentiated liposarcomas showed prominent metaplastic bone, 3 produced cartilage, and 1 also had osteosarcomatous tissue. The whorls comprised concentric distributions of spindle or epithelioid cells. All cases expressed smooth muscle actin, 3 strongly, whereas 4 cases showed at least focal claudin-1 positivity. In all cases, the whorls expressed at least 2 of CDK4, MDM2, and p16. The presence of 2 morphologic subsets and the immunohistochemical findings suggest that the whorls in these dedifferentiated liposarcomas exhibit divergent myofibroblastic and possibly perineurial differentiation. The CDK4, MDM2, and p16 expression in the whorls suggests that they share a similar genetic background to well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma, and that additional genetic events are causal to their distinct morphology.",

Currently, the diagnosis is guided by MDM2 and CDK4 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and is confirmed by the amplification of the corresponding genes. Recently, p16 IHC has been proposed as a useful diagnostic biomarker. To assess the utility of p16 IHC in the differential diagnosis of ALT\\/WDLPS and DDLPS. Our series included 101 tumors that were previously analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MDM2 and CDK4 amplification. We compared sensitivity and specificity of p16 IHC to MDM2 and CDK4 IHC in the differential diagnosis of ALT-WDLPS (n=19) versus benign adipocytic tumors (n=44) and DDLPS (n=18) versus mimicking sarcomas (n=20). In the differential diagnosis of ALT-WDLPS, p16 had a sensitivity of 89.5% but a specificity of 68.2%, which was impaired by false-positive lipomas with secondary changes, especially in biopsies. Likewise, in the differential diagnosis of DDLPS, p16 had a sensitivity of 94.4% and a specificity of 70%, which hampered its use as a single marker. However, adding p16 to MDM2 and\\/or CDK4 increased diagnostic specificity. Indeed, MDM2+\\/p16+ tumors were all ALT-WDLPS and MDM2-\\/p16- tumors were all benign adipocytic tumors. Moreover, all MDM2+\\/CDK4+\\/p16+ tumors were DDLPS and the MDM2-\\/CDK4-\\/p16- tumor was an undifferentiated sarcoma. Although the use of p16 as a single immunohistochemical marker is limited by its specificity, its combination with MDM2 and CDK4 IHC may help discriminate ALT-WDLPS\\/DDLPS.",

We demonstrate that an alteration in the CDKN2A\\/CDKN2B\\/CDK4\\/CCND1 pathway is present in almost all cases without CDK4 amplification, thereby confirming the pivotal role of this pathway in liposarcoma oncogenesis. Moreover, we show that cell cycle and differentiation are driven by a subtle and complex balance between members of this pathway.

From 1980 through 2002, 34 individuals displaying WDL were treated in our institutions. Lipoma was observed in seven of these 34 patients (five men and two women, mean age of 66.7 years). The rate of co-existence of lipoma in WDL [20.6% (7\\/34)] cases was significantly higher than the corresponding rate in the other liposarcoma subtypes [2.5% (1\\/40)]. Immunohistochemically, cdk4 was positive in all WDLs (100%). ki-67 was positive in 57.1% (4\\/7) and mdm2 and p53 were positive in 14.5% (1\\/7) of the WDL cases. Weak cdk4 immunoreactivity was detected in two lipomas. All lipomas were negative for mdm2, p53 and ki-67. Comparison of the expression profile in these malignant and benign tumors, which had arisen in identical genetic backgrounds, confirmed the involvement of these proteins, especially cdk4, in the tumorigenesis process of WDL.",

A 71-year-old patient suffered from a relapse of an atypical lipomatous tumor\\/well-differentiated liposarcoma with early micronodular (low-grade) dedifferentiation, which had been resected 4 years before. The relapse revealed features of a dedifferentiated liposarcoma with spindle-cell, partly pleomorphic dedifferentiation and osseous metaplasia. Clearly separated from the spindle-cell areas, an extensive homogeneously dense lymphoid (lymphocytic) tumor-component was evident, with relative abrupt transition to the well-differentiated liposarcoma component. Using immunohistochemistry and PCR, the lymphoid (\\\"lymphoma-like\\\") infiltrate proved to be a polyclonal lymphocytic proliferation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISII) analysis revealed no signs of MDM2- and CDK4-gene amplification in the lymphoid areas, although within this mononuclear lymphoid population, large polymorphic nuclei displayed an amplified number of MDM2\\/CDK4 gene copies, indicating the presence of truly dedifferentiated tumor cells within the lymphoid component. The results favor a reactive lymphocytic infiltration versus a neoplastic one, which might be caused for example by chemoattractive agents. An extensive lymphoid \\\"overgrowth\\\" must be considered within the spectrum of unusual variants and in the differential diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma.",

Increasing treatment efficacy may require combinations of targeted agents that counteract the effects of multiple abnormalities. To identify a possible multicomponent therapy, we performed a combinatorial drug screen in a DDLS-derived cell line and identified cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) as synergistic drug targets. We measured the phosphorylation of multiple proteins and cell viability in response to systematic drug combinations and derived computational models of the signaling network. These models predict that the observed synergy in reducing cell viability with CDK4 and IGF1R inhibitors depends on the activity of the AKT pathway. Experiments confirmed that combined inhibition of CDK4 and IGF1R cooperatively suppresses the activation of proteins within the AKT pathway. Consistent with these findings, synergistic reductions in cell viability were also found when combining CDK4 inhibition with inhibition of either AKT or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), another receptor similar to IGF1R that activates AKT. Thus, network models derived from context-specific proteomic measurements of systematically perturbed cancer cells may reveal cancer-specific signaling mechanisms and aid in the design of effective combination therapies.",

We studied the frequency of amplification of these genes in a series of 48 dedifferentiated liposarcomas and 68 atypical lipomatous tumors\\/well-differentiated liposarcomas. We correlated their amplification status with clinicopathological features and outcomes. Histologically, both CDK4 (P=0.007) and JUN (P=0.005) amplifications were associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma, whereas amplification of the proximal parts of HMGA2 (5'-untranslated region (UTR) and exons 1-3) was associated with atypical lipomatous tumor\\/well-differentiated liposarcoma (P=0.01). CDK4 amplification was associated with axial tumors. Amplification of 5'-UTR and exons 1-3 of HMGA2 was associated with primary status and grade 1. Shorter overall survival was correlated with: age >64 years (P=0.03), chemotherapy used in first intent (P<0.001), no surgery (P=0.003), grade 3 (P<0.001), distant metastasis (P<0.001), node involvement (P=0.006), and CDK4 amplification (P=0.07). In multivariate analysis, distant metastasis (HR=8.8) and grade 3 (HR=18.2) were associated with shorter overall survival. A shorter recurrence-free survival was associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (P<0.001), grade 3 (P<0.001), node involvement (P<0.001), distant metastasis (P=0.02), recurrent status (P=0.009), axial location (P=0.001), and with molecular features such as CDK4 (P=0.05) and JUN amplification (P=0.07). Amplification of 5'-UTR and exons 1-3 (P=0.08) and 3'-UTR (P=0.01) of HMGA2 were associated with longer recurrence-free survival. Distant metastasis was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival (HR=5.8) in multivariate analysis. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma type was associated with axial location, grade 3 and recurrent status. In conclusion, we showed that the amplification of HMGA2 was associated with the atypical lipomatous tumor\\/well-differentiated liposarcoma histological type and a good prognosis, whereas CDK4 and JUN amplifications were associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma histology and a bad prognosis. In addition, we also provided the first description of the molecular evolution of a well-differentiated liposarcoma into four successive dedifferentiated liposarcoma relapses, which was consistent with our general observations.",

A 65\\u00A0year old male underwent a resection of a calcified retroesophageal mass that was in close relation to the left hemithyroid and recurrent laryngeal nerve. It was resected en bloc with the left thyroid lobe. Initial pathologic evaluation suggested the mass was a schwanomma of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, but positive staining for MDM2 and CDK4 indicated the tumor was a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Further evaluation elucidated the unique meningothelial-like whorls within the tumor. This case demonstrates dedifferentiated liposarcomas do appear in the head and neck.

The tight correlation between the presence of ring chromosomes and both amplification and overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 genes suggests the exploration of the possibility that immunocytochemistry (ICC) might assist in the differential diagnosis of lipoma-like well differentiated liposarcomas (LL-WDL) and large deep-seated lipomas (LDSL). For this purpose, 21 cases of the former and 19 cases of the latter tumours were analysed by ICC and, according to the availability of material, by molecular and cytogenetic approaches. All lipomas displayed a null MDM2\\/CDK4 phenotype, whereas all LL-WDL showed MDM2\\/CDK4 or CDK4 phenotypes. Southern blot analysis performed on 16 suitable cases, complemented by fluorescence in situ hybridization and classical cytogenetic analysis in 11 cases, was consistent with, and further supported the immunophenotyping data. In conclusion, MDM2\\/CDK4 product-based immunophenotyping appears to represent a valuable method for the categorization of arguable LDSL.",

Genetically, they are characterized by amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 genes on chromosome 12q13-15. We examined a series of 559 soft tissue tumors (44 ALT-WDLPS, 61 DDLPS, 49 benign adipose tumors, and 405 non-ALT-WDLPS\\/DDLPS sarcomas) for MDM2 and CDK4 expression using immunohistochemistry. MDM2 and CDK4 immunoexpressions were compared with gene amplification status (as assessed by quantitative PCR and\\/or comparative genomic hybridization) in 241 neoplasms. Most ALT-WDLPS\\/DDLPS expressed MDM2 (97%) and CDK4 (92%) as opposed to few benign adipose tumors (MDM2, 5%; CDK4, 2%) and a limited number of non-ALT-WDLSP\\/DDLPS sarcomas (MDM2, 19%; CDK4, 6%). The sensitivity and specificity of MDM2 and CDK4 immunostainings in identifying ALT-WDLPS\\/DDLPS among other soft tissue tumors were 97% and 92%, and 83% and 95%, respectively. MDM2 and CDK4 immunostainings were particularly useful to separate ALT-WDLPS from the large group of differentiated adipose tumors, and to distinguish DDLPS from poorly differentiated sarcomas. A strong correlation was observed between MDM2 and CDK4 stainings and gene amplification status. In conclusion, MDM2 and CDK4 immunostainings, which correlate with gene amplification, are helpful adjuncts to differentiate ALT-WDLPS from benign adipose tumors and to separate DDLPS from poorly differentiated sarcomas.",

Due to absence of clinically effective treatment options in inoperable situations and resistance to chemotherapeutics, a critical need exists to identify novel therapeutic targets. We analyzed LPS genomic landscape using SNP arrays, whole exome sequencing and targeted exome sequencing to uncover the genomic information for development of specific anti-cancer targets. SNP array analysis indicated known amplified genes (MDM2, CDK4, HMGA2) and important novel genes (UAP1, MIR557, LAMA4, CPM, IGF2, ERBB3, IGF1R). Carboxypeptidase M (CPM), recurrently amplified gene in well-differentiated\\/de-differentiated LPS was noted as a putative oncogene involved in the EGFR pathway. Notable deletions were found at chromosome 1p (RUNX3, ARID1A), chromosome 11q (ATM, CHEK1) and chromosome 13q14.2 (MIR15A, MIR16-1). Significantly and recurrently mutated genes (false discovery rate < 0.05) included PLEC (27%), MXRA5 (21%), FAT3 (24%), NF1 (20%), MDC1 (10%), TP53 (7%) and CHEK2 (6%). Further, in vitro and in vivo functional studies provided evidence for the tumor suppressor role for Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene in different subtypes of LPS. Pathway analysis of recurrent mutations demonstrated signaling through MAPK, JAK-STAT, Wnt, ErbB, axon guidance, apoptosis, DNA damage repair and cell cycle pathways were involved in liposarcomagenesis. Interestingly, we also found mutational and copy number heterogeneity within a primary LPS tumor signifying the importance of multi-region sequencing for cancer-genome guided therapy. In summary, these findings provide insight into the genomic complexity of LPS and highlight potential druggable pathways for targeted therapeutic approach.",

The retroperitoneum and thigh represent the most common anatomic locations for both the sarcomas. Despite their morphologic similarity, the issue of whether these 2 sarcomas share overlapping immunohistochemical and molecular features has not been well studied. We examined the expression of the lipogenic tumor-related markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), CDK4, and MDM2 in 15 cases of DDL and 45 cases of retroperitoneal\\/thigh UHGPS. Patients with DDL ranged from 31 to 82 years (mean 63 y) with a male:female ratio of 5:3. Patients with UHGPS ranged from 14 to 80 years (mean 52 y) with a male:female ratio of 3:2. All 15 DDLs expressed CDK4 and MDM2 (100%), and 8 of 15 cases expressed PPAR-gamma (53%). Twenty-three of 45 (51%) UHGPS expressed at least 1 of these 3 markers. We also studied MDM2 and CDK4 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 28 immunohistochemically positive cases, including 5 DDLs and 23 UHGPSs. All 5 cases of DDL showed MDM2 and\\/or CDK4 amplification (100%), whereas 6 of 45 UHGPSs showed MDM2 and\\/or CDK4 amplification (13%). Our results demonstrate that (1) the lipogenic tumor markers CDK4 and MDM2 can be used as surrogate immunohistochemical markers for the diagnosis of malignant lipomatous tumors with high sensitivity; (2) approximately 26% of retroperitoneal\\/thigh UHGPS cases that were positive for PPAR-gamma, CDK4, or MDM2 by immunohistochemistry showed characteristic CDK4 and MDM2 gene amplification, suggesting that a subset of UHGPS cases represent DDL despite lacking histologic evidence of lipoblasts.",

Amplification of chromosomal region 12q13-q14, which contains the CDK4 proto-oncogene, was identified in a subset of fusion-positive RMS. Other tumor types with CDK4 amplification or overexpression, including liposarcoma and neuroblastoma, are sensitive to CDK4\\/6 inhibition, suggesting that CDK4\\/6-targeted therapies may provide a new treatment strategy in fusion-positive RMS. To evaluate the role of CDK4 in chromosomal region 12q13-14 amplification in fusion-positive RMS and the potential clinical utility of CDK4\\/6 inhibition in this disease setting, we examined the biological consequences of CDK4 knockdown, CDK4 overexpression, and pharmacologic CDK4\\/6 inhibition in fusion-positive RMS in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of CDK4 abrogated proliferation and transformation of 12q13-14-amplified and non-amplified fusion-positive RMS cells via G1-phase cell cycle arrest. This arrest was associated with reduced RB phosphorylation and E2F-responsive gene expression. Significant differences in E2F target expression, however, were not observed in RMS cells overexpressing CDK4 or in fusion-positive tumors harboring 12q13-14 amplification relative to control cells or tumors lacking amplification, respectively. Treatment with the small molecule CDK4\\/6 inhibitor LEE011 phenocopied CDK4 knockdown, decreasing viability, RB phosphorylation, and E2F-responsive gene expression and inducing G1-phase cell cycle arrest. All fusion-positive RMS cell lines showed sensitivity to CDK4\\/6 inhibition, with evidence of differential antitumor activity resulting from an inverse relationship between CDK4 expression and inhibitor vulnerability. This variable responsiveness to LEE011 was recapitulated in xenograft models of CDK4-amplified and non-amplified fusion-positive RMS. Our findings demonstrate that CDK4 is necessary for RB-E2F-mediated G1-phase cell cycle progression, proliferation, and transformation in fusion-positive RMS regardless of CDK4 amplification status. Our studies further indicate that single-agent LEE011 is active in the setting of fusion-positive RMS and suggest that CDK4 amplification may be a marker of reduced sensitivity whereas low CDK4 expression may be associated with higher susceptibility to CDK4\\/6 inhibition. Collectively, our data provide preclinical evidence supporting further investigation of CDK4\\/6-targeted therapies in treatment regimens for fusion-positive RMS."

It occurs almost exclusively in adults and is found most often in the thigh or retroperitoneum. It rarely arises from a lipoma and does not occur in the subcutaneous tissues. Liposarcomas are divided into histologic subtypes with different microscopic appearances and slightly different behavior characteristics. Surgical resection with a wide surgical margin is the treatment of choice. When amputation is required to obtain an adequate surgical margin, local irradiation can be used as an adjuvant and a limb-sparing operation can be done. Currently, no evidence exists that adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated for patients with liposarcoma, although numerous studies are being done to investigate its use. As is the case for all sarcomas, the lung is the most common site of metastasis; however, liposarcoma has an unusual propensity to metastasize to the retroperitoneum, mediastinum, and bone.",

It usually presents as a single mass, and the prognosis varies according to the degree of histological differentiation. Multicentric liposarcoma is an unusual presentation of this tumour in which several independent lesions develop and generally display an aggressive pattern. It may be difficult to establish a precise diagnosis because of the problems differentiating between recurrence or metastasis of a single liposarcoma and multicentric primary lesions. A systematic review was undertaken, assessing articles on multicentric liposarcoma, with emphasis on the diagnostic criteria and treatment for this condition. Illustrative cases of multicentric liposarcoma from our Institution are presented.",

Macroscopic examination identified in the antral wall a 9-cm, well-circumscribed, nodular lesion, with a yellow, greasy cut surface. On histological examination, the tumor was composed of a mature adipocytes proliferation, showing significant variation in cell size, associated to some lipoblasts. Nuclei were sometimes large, slightly irregular, but without hyperchromasia nor mitosis. Diagnosis of a well-differentiated liposarcoma was suspected and molecular cytogenetic analyses showed no MDM2 nor CDK4 gene amplification on fluorescent in situ hybridization. The diagnosis of lipoma was made. Twelve months following surgery, the patient is doing well.",

This neoplasm has a remarkable tendency to recurrence after surgical excision, rarely to metastasize. Recurrence usually shows a more aggressive behaviour than primitive disease with a higher tendency to penetrate into adjacent organs. The symptomatology often appears late and the first sign is frequently a palpable abdominal mass. Preoperative study involves using CT and MRI. The surgical resection is the only tool able to modify natural history with regard to survival and local recurrence. Prognosis is severe, with a survival of 5 years, variable from 12 to 50% in the different series. A very important prognostic factor is the degree of tumour and radical surgical treatment. From 1990 to 2001, 32 operations for malignant retroperitoneal tumors were performed by our surgical unit in 19 patients; in 7 of them the tumor was a liposarcoma (4 male and 3 female). Total operations for retroperitoneal liposarcoma were 15, in 4 patients a second operation was performed for recurrence, in 3 a third operation and in 1 a fourth. Eleven cases out of 15 have undergone exeresis of sarcoma. Average survival consisted in 4 years and 2 months. Intraoperative radiotherapy, performed in 3 patients, perhaps is able to offer some advantages in relation to local control of the disease and of the survival. A possible resection of eventual recurrence justifies a early follow up with CT and MRI.",

However, some reports have demonstrated specific differentiation in these areas, with histologic features resembling those of rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma. We report here a pathologic and genetic analysis of three cases of DDLs with rhabdomyosarcomatous areas. MFH- or fibrosarcoma-like areas of one primary DDL and two recurrent DDLs contained various amounts of rhabdomyoblasts, which were immunoreactive for desmin, myoglobin, muscle actin (HHF-35), and myogenin. An ultrastructural examination demonstrated rhabdomyoblasts with abundant cytoplasm containing thin and thick filaments and Z-bands. By real-time PCR, amplification of mdm2 and cdk4 was confirmed in both well-differentiated and dedifferentiated areas with rhabdomyoblasts of all cases. To our knowledge, only seven cases of DDLs with rhabdomyosarcomatous components have been reported, and furthermore, the genetic profiles of the rhabdomyosarcomatous components in DDLs have not been investigated. This study demonstrates that DDLs with rhabdomyosarcomatous areas have genetic alterations that are common to well-differentiated\\/dedifferentiated liposarcomas.",

The phenomenon of dedifferentiation is time dependent, and primary or de novo tumors exceed secondary neoplasms in a ratio of 9:1. The tumor occurs most frequently in adults beyond the 6th decade of life, slightly predominates in men, and involves the abdominal cavity most often. Pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like histologic features are the most commonly observed phenotype, although other sarcomatous phenotypes have been described less frequently. Surgical treatment is the main form of therapy for dedifferentiated liposarcoma, which is associated with a reported local recurrence rate of 41% to 52%, 15% distant metastatic rate, and 30% disease-related mortality rate. On a chromosomal level, dedifferentiated liposarcoma frequently displays the same chromosomal abnormality associated with well-differentiated liposarcomas--ie, the presence of a supernumerary ring or giant chromosome derived from the 12q(13-15) region.",

Consideration are expressed on the clinical symptoms, the pathological anatomy, its marked tendency to evolve with repeated local relapses and the need to properly localise the mass and the feeding peduncles prior to the operation, so that radical exercise can be performed, since this leads to a more favourable long-term prognosis. The utility of radiotherapy, which leads to a lengthened period of freedom from the disease and to an increased  survival time, is also stressed.",

This genetic alteration might result in specific gene-expression profiles in this tumor entity. To identify over-expressed genes in myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma DNA microarray analysis was performed on four tumors and four samples of adult fat tissue. Genes ret, cdk4, cyclin D2 and c-myc showed over-expression by means of microarray analysis and Northern blotting. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated cytoplasmic localization of associated proteins in 36 different tumors. The localization of ret was seen in endothelial cells of plexiform vasculature in addition to its accumulation in tumor cells (25% of cases). The results show an over-expression of cdk4, cyclin D2, c-myc and ret on both the transcriptional and protein level in myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma. For cyclin D2 and ret this finding has not been reported in this tumor type. The increase of ret on transcriptional level might be explained by its expression in endothelium in intratumoral plexiform blood vessels. For the molecular pathogenesis of myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma our findings imply the involvement of these four genes in the deregulation of the cell cycle, especially as cdk4 and cyclin D2 are target genes of c-myc.",

A correlative cytologic and histologic study of a myxoid liposarcoma of the shoulder in a 72 year-old man and a pleomorphic liposarcoma observed in the retroperitoneum of a 84 year-old woman, are presented. A preoperative FNAB cytology performed in both cases showed necrotic material containing spindle-stellate shaped cells, interspersed in a myxoid matrix, with rare classical monovacuolated lipoblasts and fragments of plessiform vessels were seen in the first and scattered pleomorphic and multinucleated cells, with prominent nucleoli and numerous atypical mitosis in the second. A malignant mesenchimal spindle-cells tumor, with myxoid matrix and pleomorphic cells, consistent with liposarcoma, respectively were suspected. Gross and histological specimens confirmed the cytological suspect. Authors discuss main cyto-histological differential diagnoses of myxoid tumors, and point out the importance and a correct differentiation between myxoid liposarcoma and intramuscular myxoma. The cytologic appearance of pleomorphic liposarcoma is similar to histologic type and therefore the problem of a differential diagnosis with soft tissue tumors is analogous. When mono or plurivacuolated lipoblasts are absent, differential diagnosis between pleomorphic histiocytoma and liposarcoma is impossible. Nevertheless this is not a important problem at cytological level because both tumors have a had prognosis and must be treated with radical surgery. Definition of correct histologic type will be more suitable on histologic specimens.",

There was another mass to the left of the first, situated on the ventral side of the left kidney. Also, another mass was intramurally found adjacent to the curvatura ventriculi major. Histologically, the mass on the curvatura ventriculi major ranged from the peritoneal cavity to the retroperitoneum Its intraperitoneal portion was classified as a differentiated lipoma-like type and the retroperitoneal mass was of mucous type. The mass on the left kidney was of a differentiated fibrosing type. The intramural mass in the gastric curvature was found to be a differentiated lipoma-like type. The patient has been under observation for 12 months and has shown no recurrence.",

Three SNPs (rs2870820, rs1695147, rs3730536) of MDM2 showed significant differences in single-loci genotypes and allele frequencies between case and control groups (p < 0.05). The minor allele G of SNP rs10760502 in FPGS (folylpolyglutamate synthase) gene was significantly associated with increased risk for primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma, compared with major allele A.

Liposarcoma cells resemble primary mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, early, midstage and late lipoblasts or mature lipocytes. But certain differences also exist: First, atypia in liposarcoma cells, such as the appearance of mono- or multinuclei giant lipoblasts in some cases. Second, certain types of liposarcoma are predominated by lipoblasts of a specific stage. Under electron microscope, transitional morphology from both primary mesenchymal cell and fibroblast to lipoblast can be observed, which is an indication that lipoblasts may originate from these two types of cells.

DDL is defined as nonlipogenic sarcoma that is juxtaposed to WDL, occurs as a recurrence of WDL or which can arise de novo, and typically has the appearance of undifferentiated pleomorphic or spindle cell sarcoma. DDL have a propensity for local recurrence, whereas distant metastasis is rarer, and behavior is related to anatomic site, with retroperitoneal neoplasms showing a significantly worse prognosis. Surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment, and medical options for patients with aggressive recurrent or metastatic disease are limited. DDL share similar genetic abnormalities to WDL, with high-level amplifications of chromosome 12q14-15, including the MDM2 and CDK4 cell cycle oncogenes, and DDL harbor additional genetic changes, particularly coamplifications of 6q23 and 1p32. Novel therapies targeted at the gene products of chromosome 12 are being tested in clinical trials. We review the pathology and genetics of DDL, discussing morphologic patterns, immunohistochemical and genetic findings, the differential diagnosis, and future therapeutic strategies.",

They are locally invasive and have a peak incidence in the fifth decade of life. They account for 0.1-0.2% of all solid tumors and 15% of all soft-tissue tumors. Liposarcomas are usually large and occur most frequently in the lower extremities, in the retroperitoneal, perineal and mesenteric region. In the retroperitoneum they grow slowly due to the ability of the abdominal cavity to accommodate these slowly expanding masses. They don't produce symptoms until they are very large and have invaded local tissues. The case of a 61-year old man with a retroperitoneal liposarcoma is reported. The tumor was discovered due to the association of abdominal mass, weight loss and persistent fever. The fever, especially, is present due to a wide tumor necrosis. The diagnosis was suggested by computed tomography. Normally, the interval between start of symptoms and diagnosis is included within three weeks and one year. Surgical complete resection of the mass with splenectomy and local postoperative radiotherapy were performed. The weight of the mass was 8.56 kilograms and the pathological evaluation showed a pleomorphic highly undifferentiated liposarcoma. This histological type normally presents many tumor giant cells, some of which have the features of lipoblasts. The single most important prognostic factor in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas is the histologic grade of the primary lesion. In the last AJCC Staging System the grades are assigned from grade 1 (well differentiated) to grade 3 (poorly differentiated). The present case is grade 3. In the treatment of sarcoma of the retroperitoneum or genitourinary tract, the conventional chemotherapy does not seem effective, while radiotherapy has a little improvement on survival. Local recurrences are frequent, especially in the first three years, often in the absence of distant metastases. When the tumor recurs locally, the best therapy is still to remove the mass. Sometimes, two or more operations may be necessary for the patient. Generally, the prognosis is poor with overall 5-year survival of 15-50%. The patient was admitted in our division 4 months after the first operation with poor medical condition. The patient died nine months after surgery.",

A computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneous tumor, compressing the right lower lobe of the lung. Because of the fatty tissue component in the tumor on the chest computed tomography, and the appearance as an extrapulmonary mass, preoperative diagnosis was posterior mediastinal liposarcoma. But thoracotomy revealed that the tumor originated from the lung. Right lower lobectomy and lymph node dissection was carried out with no additional therapy. The pathological diagnosis was pleomorphic liposarcoma originated from the lung. Two months after the operation, the patient died of respiratory failure due to local recurrence.",

A distinctive t(12;16)(q13;p11) reciprocal translocation rearranges the CHOP gene localized to 12q13 in most cases. Data concerning the occurrence of cell cycle aberrations in this subset of mesenchymal malignancies are very limited. Therefore, we analyzed a histologically homogeneous series of 21 cases of myxoid and round cell liposarcoma. The p53 pathway was studied by investigating the TP53 gene and protein, mdm2 protein, and p21Waf1 protein. The Rb-cyclin D pathway was analyzed by studying the pRb protein, the p16MTS1 gene, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, p27Kip1, cdk4, and cdk6 proteins. In contrast with the rare involvement of the TP53 gene in well differentiated liposarcoma, aberrations of the TP53 gene were observed in approximately 30% of cases of myxoid and round cell liposarcoma. Notably, mdm2 overexpression was seen in 56% of cases and correlated with histological grade, therefore indicating a possible role in tumor progression. Abnormalities involving the Rb-cyclin D pathway were observed in more than 90% of cases. pRb loss was present in one-third of cases and, at variance with that observed in other subsets of sarcoma, overexpression of cyclin Ds represented a rare event. Interestingly, upregulation of either cdk4 or cdk6 was demonstrated in 85% of cases.",

Presence of numerous fine fibrous septa in the lipomatous tumor tissue is thought to be responsible for this interesting phenomenon. Of interest is the fact that the direction of these lines changed according to the probe format used: parallel horizontal lines when using a linear probe and concentric lines converging toward the probe when using a sector or curved linear probe. In contrast, pleomorphic liposarcoma does not show this US sign. Knowledge of these US findings is useful for the diagnosis of retroperitoneal liposarcoma.",

This tumor type occurs exceptionally rarely in the gastrointestinal tract with only few cases described in the literature. In this case we present a 73-year-old male patient who was admitted due to loss of weight, anorexia and postprandial emesis with dysphagy. Gastrographin esophagography failed to make precise diagnostics. CT scan of the upper gastrointestinal tract revealed a large esophageal tumor filling out the whole length of the esophagus. The tumor was removed by parasternocleidomastoidal approach with a stapler. Histopathological examination revealed a well-differentiated liposarcoma (grade I). Well-differentiated liposarcomas are characterised by amplified material of the 12q13-15 chromosomal region, present in the form of giant or ring chromosomes and leading to the overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 genes. MDM2 and CDK4 proteins can be detected immunhistochemically, which was the case in the reported tumor. Overexpression of these proteins leads to suppression of tumor suppressor genes, leading to increased cell survival.",

The tumor was bean-sized and was located subconjunctivally without connecting orbital tissues. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed numerous neoplastic cells containing stellate and hyperchromatic nucleus. The cytoplasm of these cells contained vacuoles resembling lipid droplets. Signet-ring type cells were also observed. These cells were considered to be lipoblasts. The stroma was myxomatous and thin-walled vessels were observed. The present tumor was confirmed by histopathological study as myxoid liposarcoma and considered to be of bulbar conjunctiva origin.

The molecular pathogenesis of this malignancy is still poorly understood and, therefore, we developed a mouse model with conditional inactivation of PTEN and p53 to investigate these pathways in the progression of the disease.\\u2009We show that deletion of these two tumor suppressors cooperate in the formation of multiple subtypes of LPS (from well-differentiated LPS to pleomorphic LPS). In addition, progression of the tumors is further characterized by the expression of D cyclins and CDK4\\/6, which allow for continued cell division. Microarray analysis also revealed novel genes that are differentially expressed between different subtypes of LPS, which could aid in understanding the disease and to unravel potential new therapeutic targets.",

Histological diagnosis is usually easy. However, the tumor may sometimes undergo significant inflammatory changes leading to a difficult differential diagnosis with well-differentiated liposarcoma. Authors report the case of a 51-year-old man, presenting with epigastralgia of recent onset. Physical exam was unremarkable. Endoscopy revealed a large, ulcerated, submucosal, and antral tumor. CT scan showed an antral mass with fat attenuation. The patient underwent a total gastrectomy. Macroscopic examination identified in the antral wall a 9-cm, well-circumscribed, nodular lesion, with a greasy cut surface. On histological examination, the tumor was composed of a mature adipocytes proliferation, showing significant variation in cell size, associated to some lipoblasts. Nuclei were sometimes large, irregular, neither with hyperchromasia nor mitosis. Diagnosis of a well-differentiated liposarcoma was suspected and molecular cytogenetic analyses showed neither MDM2 nor CDK4 gene amplification on fluorescent in situ hybridization. The diagnosis of lipoma was made. Twelve months after surgery, the patient is doing well. In conclusion, Differentiating benign from malignant fatty tumors is sometimes difficult in morphologic features. In these cases, cytogenetic procedures are the only means for an accurate diagnosis.",

Pathologic analysis following wide local excision revealed a large, high grade sarcomatous component with highly pleomorphic cells with a thin rim of well-differentiated and myxoid liposarcoma on histologic examination. Dedifferentiated liposarcomas arising outside of the retroperitoneum are very rare, as are dedifferentiated liposarcomas arising from a histologically mixed liposarcoma.

Rarely, however, primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma is classified as myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma, based on the presence of myxoid areas and vascular crow's feet pattern, which has resulted in a debate on the classification of liposarcoma in the retroperitoneum. Genetically, myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma and well-\\/dedifferentiated liposarcoma are different diseases. Myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma is characterized by a translocation causing FUS-CHOP or EWSR1-CHOP fusion, whereas well-\\/dedifferentiated liposarcoma is characterized by an amplification of the 12q13-15 region, including MDM2 and CDK4 genes. As myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma is highly radio- and chemosensitive, differentiation between subtypes is important to optimize treatment. We studied whether primary retroperitoneal liposarcomas diagnosed as myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma represent molecularly true myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma or are histopathological mimics and represent well-\\/dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Primary retroperitoneal myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma (n=16) were compared to primary extremity myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma (n=20). Histopathological and immunohistochemical features were studied. Amplification status of the 12q13-15 region was studied using a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis, and FUS-CHOP or EWS-CHOP translocations were studied using RT-PCR. In primary retroperitoneal myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma, MDM2 and CDK4 staining was both positive in 12 of 15 cases. In primary extremity myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma, MDM2 was negative in 18\\/20 and CDK4 was negative in all cases. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification showed the amplification of 12q13-15 region in 16\\/16 primary retroperitoneal myxoid\\/round cell liposarcomas and in 1\\/20 primary extremity myxoid\\/round cell liposarcomas. Translocation was present in all (18\\/18) primary extremity myxoid\\/round cell liposarcomas, but absent in all primary retroperitoneal myxoid\\/round cell liposarcomas. On the basis of immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics, apparent primary retroperitoneal myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma can be recognized as well-\\/dedifferentiated liposarcoma with morphological features mimicking myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma. In these cases, treatment should probably be specifically designed as for well-\\/dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Moreover, finding of myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma translocations in a retroperitoneal localization is highly suggestive of metastasis and should prompt search for a primary localization outside the retroperitoneum.",

Abdominal computed tomography(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) revealed a large mass that occupied almost the entire abdominal cavity. She underwent surgery under the diagnosis of retroperitoneal liposarcoma. The tumor originated from the left lower pelvis. The tumor weighed 18 kg, and the histopathological diagnosis was well-differentiated liposarcoma. Seven years after the operation, local recurrence was found without any complaints. The operation was performed again. The tumor weighed 750 g, and it originated from the same area as observed in the first operation. The histopathological diagnosis was well-differentiated liposarcoma. Case 2: An 82-year-old woman complained of abdominal distension. A new dumbbell-like solid tumor was identified as retroperitoneal liposarcoma by CT and MRI findings, and it was growing rapidly. The tumor was removed with the cecum and right kidney in a curative operation. The tumor weighed 2.6 kg, and the histopathological diagnosis was dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The best treatment for retroperitoneal liposarcoma is curative resection. However, dedifferentiation occasionally occurs over time and in recurrent cases. It is important to follow-up strictly for retroperitoneal liposarcoma.",

We present the immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular cytogenetic findings of DDLS arising in the right chest wall of a 76-year-old man. Magnetic resonance imaging exhibited a large mass composed of two components with heterogeneous signal intensities, suggesting the coexistence of a fatty area and another soft tissue component. The grossly heterogeneous mass was histologically composed of an ALT\\/WDLS component transitioning abruptly into a dedifferentiated component. Immunohistochemistry was positive for murine double-minute 2 (MDM2), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and p16 in both components, although a more strong and diffuse staining was found in the dedifferentiated area. The MIB-1 labeling index was extremely higher in the dedifferentiated area compared to the ALT\\/WDLS area. Cytogenetic analysis of the ALT\\/WDLS component revealed the following karyotype: 46,X,-Y,+r. Notably, cytogenetic analysis of the dedifferentiated component revealed a similar but more complex karyotype. Spectral karyotyping demonstrated that the ring chromosome was entirely composed of material from chromosome 12. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 in both components. These findings suggest that multiple abnormal clones derived from a single precursor cell would be present in DDLS, with one or more containing supernumerary rings or giant marker chromosomes.",

                    "abstract": "A recurrent intrachromosomal rearrangement on chromosome 12q in solitary fibrous tumor leads to the formation of a NAB2-STAT6 fusion oncogene. As a result, nuclear expression of the cytoplasmic transcription factor STAT6 is found in solitary fibrous tumor and serves as a useful diagnostic marker. STAT6 is located in 12q13, a region containing well-characterized oncogenes that are commonly amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma; we have previously reported that STAT6 is expressed in a subset of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of STAT6 expression in dedifferentiated liposarcoma and the underlying genetic mechanism. STAT6 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a well-characterized series of 35 previously unpublished cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, all with nuclear MDM2 and\\/or CDK4 expression by immunohistochemistry and\\/or cytogenetic features of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. FISH for STAT6 was performed in all cases with STAT6 expression, and a subset of control cases without STAT6 expression. In total 4\\/35 cases (11%) showed STAT6 expression (three with multifocal staining of moderate to strong intensity and one with weak focal staining). FISH demonstrated amplification of STAT6 in all cases positive for STAT6 by immunohistochemistry; in contrast, FISH performed on four STAT6-negative dedifferentiated liposarcomas demonstrated no STAT6 amplification (P=0.0286). Of the four STAT6 amplified cases, three patients were male and one was female, ranging in age from 51 to 76 years. Tumors were located in the mediastinum (n=2), paratesticular soft tissue (n=1), and perirenal soft tissue (n=1). Three patients received pre-operative chemotherapy +\\/- radiation therapy. In conclusion, STAT6 is amplified in a subset of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, resulting in STAT6 protein expression that can be detected by immunohistochemistry and may be a potential pitfall in the differential diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma and solitary fibrous tumor. These findings suggest a role for STAT6-mediated transcriptional activity in some cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma and highlight the genomic complexity and heterogeneity of dedifferentiated liposarcoma.",

The main tumor mass was located within the submucosa and caused chronic subileus by subtotal obstruction of the jejunum. The histology showed a mixed type liposarcoma. In the main mass features of well differentiated lipoma-like and sclerosing liposarcoma predominated. In the tumor periphery they were combined with areas of pleomorphic liposarcoma, consisting of tightly packed giant lipoblasts. After an incomplete resection well differentiated sclerosing and pleomorphic liposarcoma recurred within the intestinal wall and in the mesentery near the primary anastomosis. The unusual primary site and pattern of spread of the tumor are discussed and the literature is reviewed.",

Rarely myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma is associated with areas of well-differentiated or pleomorphic liposarcoma (mixed liposarcoma). We describe the clinicopathological features of three unusual myxoid\\/round cell liposarcomas which showed morphological features of de novo dedifferentiation. All patients were male and were aged 66, 70 and 76 years, respectively. One lesion each arose in the retroperitoneum, inguinal region and peritoneal cavity. Histologically, in one case the myxoid\\/round cell component was juxtaposed to a high-grade non-lipogenic component resembling non-pleomorphic storiform 'malignant fibrous histiocytoma' ('MFH'), one case showed a combination of myxoid liposarcoma and a high-grade myxofibrosarcoma-like component (so-called myxoid 'MFH'), and in the third case, a well-differentiated myxoid liposarcoma with a discontinuous micronodular pattern of dedifferentiation was seen. Follow-up information of 30, 28 and 26 months revealed two recurrences each in two patients. These patients died of postoperative pulmonary embolism and abdominal haemorrhage, respectively; systemic metastases were not noted. These cases demonstrate that myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma can show, albeit very rarely, histological features of dedifferentiation. Cases like these, combined with the occurrence of mixed-type liposarcoma (well-differentiated\\/myxoid liposarcoma) and the vicinity of chromosomal regions involved by specific karyotypic aberrations in these tumours, suggest that myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma and well-differentiated liposarcoma (including its dedifferentiated variant) are more closely related in biological terms than is generally believed.",

Although liposarcoma is only 0.1% of all human neoplasms, it is the most common histology subtype of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas. This tumor grows slowly. Diffuse abdominal pain is its most frequent symptom and abdominal mass is the most common sign. Aggressive surgical treatment is basic to get a complete resection and a local disease control. This objective is difficult because of the large tumor size it gets in the retroperitoneal location and the multiorgan involvement that require the resection of a high percentage of contiguous organs. We report a case of a giant retroperitoneal liposarcoma presenting like continuous left hemiabdominal pain because of the visceral compression. The right kidney was involved and suffering from renal vessel enlargement without renal function. There is a high probability of microscopic residual disease and a good follow-up of the patients is necessary as well as an adjuvant radiation therapy in some cases.",

The amplicons were discontinuous; there were non-amplified marker loci between the amplified marker loci. These findings indicate the presence of separate amplicons in the 12q13-22 region. Evidence of the concomitant gain of one allele and loss of the other allele was found with several markers in one tumor and with one marker in two tumor specimens.

Follow-up was obtained in all. Sites of tumour were peripheral limb in 45 patients, limb girdle in 15, retroperitoneal area in 23 and trunk and neck in 21. Fifty-seven percent of the patients were men: the disease was most commonly found in patients aged 50 to 69 years. Initial treatment was excision in 96 patients with irradiation in 26 and chemotherapy in 6. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 60% and 49% respectively. In those who had definitive surgery the prognosis was somewhat better, while radiotherapy had little beneficial effect. Prognosis was also related to the pathologic type; well differentiated and myxoid types had a better prognosis than round cell or pleomorphic tumours. Trunk and peripheral limb tumours were associated with higher survival rates than limb girdle or retroperitoneal neoplasms. At least 37 patients had local recurrences; distant metastases occurred in at least 26, most commonly to the lungs, bones and liver. Unusual cases consisted of a patient with a multicentric tumour involving bones, a young boy with a neck liposarcoma and a woman with a breast liposarcoma.",

It was composed of two distinct macroscopic and histologic features--the well-differentiated liposarcoma and the cellular, nonlipogenic pleomorphic sarcoma. The former was a mature, lipomatous tumor with various stages of lipoblasts. The latter was much more cellular, made up of pleomorphic cells admixed with a few areas of spindle cells with many mitotic figures, resembling a pleomorphic variant of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Oil red O stain revealed multifocal, but a scanty amount, of fat-storing tumor cells in both compartments aside from large fat globules in the differentiated area. This is the first reported case of primary liposarcoma of the liver.",

                    "abstract": "Liposarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma and accounts for approximately 20% of all mesenchymal malignancies. In the last decade, the results of several studies have led to the delineation of new variants as well as to the introduction of new concepts, mainly as a result of the fruitful interactions between genetics and pathology. Spindle cell liposarcoma represents an uncommon variant of well-differentiated liposarcoma. It tends to occur in adults and often involves the subcutaneous soft tissue. However, from the observation of a larger number of cases, the anatomic distribution of spindle cell liposarcoma seems to be comparable to that of the other well-differentiated liposarcoma subtypes. Spindle cell liposarcoma tends to recur locally and may dedifferentiate. Morphologically it is composed of a fairly bland neural-like spindle cell proliferation set in a fibrous and\\/or myxoid background and is associated with an atypical lipomatous component. Great debate has been generated by the introduction of the term atypical lipoma to emphasize the fact that well-differentiated liposarcoma shows risk of local recurrence but no potential for metastasis. In our opinion well-differentiated liposarcoma and atypical lipoma should be considered synonyms that describe lesions identical both morphologically and kayotypically. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma is a distinct type of liposarcoma in which transition from low-grade to high-grade nonlipogenic morphology within a well-differentiated liposarcoma is observed. The transition usually occurs in an abrupt fashion; however, in rare cases it can be more gradual. Recently, it also has been proposed that dedifferentiated liposarcoma should be further classified into low and high grade. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma rarely exhibits heterologous (most often myoid) differentiation. A peculiar \\\"neural-like whorling pattern\\\" of dedifferentiation also has been described recently. Surprisingly, the clinical outcome of dedifferentiated liposarcoma is less aggressive that in other high-grade pleomorphic sarcomas but genetic as well as molecular data exist that may partiallyjustify such a discrepancy. Myxoid and round cell liposarcoma, even if still classified by the World Health Organization as two distinct subtypes, share both clinical and morphologic features. Lesions combining both patterns are very frequent and wide agreement exists in considering round cell liposarcoma as the high-grade counterpart of myxoid liposarcoma. Furthermore, myxoid and round cell liposarcoma share the same characteristic chromosome change. Albeit rare, it has been recently shown that liposarcoma indeed can occur as a primary skin lesion. It often presents clinically as a dome-shaped or polypoid lesion that, histologically, most frequently shows high-grade morphologic features but carries a comparatively good prognosis. Considering currently available data, the most logical classification of liposarcoma is into three main groups: (1) well-differentiated liposarcoma (including adipocytic, sclerosing, inflammatory, spindle-cell, and dedifferentiated variants), characterized by ring or long markers chromosomes derived from the long arm of chromosome 12; (2) myxoid and round cell (poorly differentiated myxoid) liposarcoma, characterized in most cases by a reciprocal translocation t(12;16)(q13;p11); and (3) pleomorphic liposarcoma, characterized by complex karyotypes.",

He had been kept elsewhere on oral steroids without evidence of any clinical response over an 8-week period with suspected diagnosis of an inflammatory pseudotumor upon referral to our clinic. An intraoperative biopsy positive for primary liposarcoma was followed by debulking surgery. Exenteration and radiotherapy were performed after pathologic confirmation of this diagnosis. No recurrence has been observed after 2 years of follow-up. We underline the importance of an accurate an early diagnosis in the management of this tumor, delayed in this case because of therapy with steroids.",

                    "abstract": "Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (LPS) is a malignant adipocytic neoplasm defined as the transition from well-differentiated LPS to a nonlipogenic sarcoma. Heterologous differentiation is seen in 5% to 10% of dedifferentiated LPS, usually with myogenic or osteo\\/chondrosarcomatous elements. Adipocytic differentiation in the dedifferentiated component is incompatible with the current definition of dedifferentiated LPS. Pleomorphic LPS is a high-grade sarcoma containing lipoblasts. At least in areas, pleomorphic LPS can be indistinguishable from dedifferentiated LPS, except for the presence of lipoblasts in pleomorphic LPS and well-differentiated LPS areas in dedifferentiated LPS. We evaluated 12 unusual liposarcomas: 11 cases with pleomorphic LPS-like morphology affecting patients with concomitant or previous well-differentiated\\/dedifferentiated LPS, and 1 case resembling inflammatory \\\"MFH\\\" with scattered lipoblasts. Clinical and histologic features were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry for MDM2 and CDK4 was carried out. Amplification of 12q13 to q15 was studied by FISH analysis of the HMGA2 locus. The tumors arose in the retroperitoneum (7), proximal lower extremity (3), chest wall (1), and neck (1) of 9 males and 3 females (median age 66 y; range 49 to 76). Size ranged from 9 to 32 cm (median 23 cm). In 3 cases, there was an abrupt transition between well-differentiated LPS and sheets of pleomorphic lipoblasts, indistinguishable from pleomorphic LPS. Four cases consisted of otherwise typical dedifferentiated LPS (with adjacent well-differentiated LPS), except for the presence of lipoblasts in the high-grade component. One case contained both nonlipogenic spindle cell areas and an inflammatory \\\"MFH\\\"-like component with numerous admixed lipoblasts. Four cases were composed exclusively of pleomorphic LPS-like areas developing in 1 of the recurrences or metastases of a prior typical dedifferentiated LPS. Two cases also showed heterologous smooth muscle differentiation. MDM2 and CDK4 were positive in both the dedifferentiated LPS and pleomorphic LPS-like components in 12\\/12 and 11\\/12 cases, respectively. FISH analysis showed high-level amplification of 12q14.3 in all 8 cases successfully tested. Karyotypes were available for 3 cases and showed ring and giant marker chromosomes. Follow-up, available for 11 patients, ranged from 19 to 196 months (median 36 mo). Seven patients developed local recurrences (multiple in 3), and 3 developed lung metastases. Thus far, 5 patients have died of disease, 3 are alive with recurrent or metastatic disease, and 3 are alive with no evidence of disease. We conclude that dedifferentiated LPS can show lipoblastic differentiation in the high-grade component, resulting in areas indistinguishable from pleomorphic LPS. The available clinical and molecular data support the notion of \\\"homologous\\\" lipoblastic differentiation in dedifferentiated LPS, rather than mixed-type LPS.",

                    "abstract": "Liposarcoma represents a unique model insofar as some well-differentiated liposarcomas progress to non-lipogenic, so-called 'dedifferentiated,' forms. The well-differentiated and dedifferentiated family of liposarcomas demonstrates amplification of the chromosome subregion 12q13-q15 with resultant amplification of the MDM2 and CDK4 genes. However, the specific genetic changes that distinguish between well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas are less well understood. To study the genetic changes in dedifferentiated liposarcomas, paired well-differentiated and dedifferentiated components of 29 tumors were analyzed separately by array-based comparative genomic hybridization. A bacterial artificial chromosome array at approximately 1-Mb resolution was used. The genetic changes were compared with clinical presentation, grade of the dedifferentiated component and overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4. Most tumors (n=21, 72%) were retroperitoneal, with both components present at initial diagnosis (n=25, 86%). Eight tumors (28%) were classified as low-grade dedifferentiation. In four cases (14%), a well-differentiated liposarcoma preceded the presentation of the dedifferentiated tumor by 1-5 years. 12q13-q15 was amplified in all tumors. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of copy-number changes, all but two tumors showed close similarities between well-differentiated and dedifferentiated components, and segregated as pairs. Dedifferentiated components had more total amplifications (P=0.008) and a trend for gain at 19q13.2, but no genetic changes were significant in distinguishing between the two components. High-level amplifications of 1p21-32 (n=7, 24%), 1q21-23 (n=9, 31%), 6q23-24 (n=6, 21%) and 12q24 (n=3, 10%) were common, but none significantly correlated with differentiation. Presentation and grade correlated with the frequency of changes at a number of genetic loci (P<0.001), whereas CDK4 immunostaining showed negative correlation with 12q13.13 amplification. The genotypic similarity, at the limit of the array's resolution, between components implies that most genetic changes precede phenotypic 'progression,' early in tumorigenesis. The relationship between genetic changes and presentation or grade may reflect differences in factors that control genomic instability or the background genotype of the tumor.",

Case 1: the patient was a 24-year-old male who noticed a left intrascrotal mass which was histologically demonstrated to be a myxoid type liposarcoma. Case 2: the patient was a 66-year-old male who had the complaint of a left intrascrotal swelling. He underwent radical orchiectomy and histologic examination of the resected tumor revealed a well-differentiated type of liposarcoma. These two cases are the 41st and 42nd intrascrotal liposarcomas reported in Japan.",

Its clinical and pathological behavior can only be predicted by comparison with the behavior of liposarcoma in other parts of the body. We describe the management of a man who presented with symptoms related to bladder outlet obstruction and was found to have a prostatic mass on digital examination of the rectum. A needle biopsy was performed and the tissue was histologically consistent with sarcoma of the prostate. Computerized tomography suggested that the mass extended through the urogenital diaphragm and was contiguous with the corpus spongiosum and corpora cavernosa of the penis. Complete surgical extirpation was achieved through a perineal approach, although local extension of the growth beneath the internal anal sphincter and the urogenital diaphragm necessitated reconstruction of these structures. The surgical margins were free of tumor. We advocate local surgical extirpation rather than pelvic exenteration in these cases.",

Two years later after the death of the younger sister, pleomorphic liposarcoma, 8 x 8 cm in size, was noticed in a 39-year-old male who died with local recurrence and multiple metastasis one year after the operation. Their mother (69 years old) had had an operation for malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the right thigh at age 66. There was no evidence of multiple lipomatosis, an autosomal dominant trait, in the siblings or their family. Diverse soft-tissue sarcomas, but not liposarcoma, occur excessively in siblings with the syndrome of Li-Fraumeni. To our knowledge this is the first such report of its sibship occurrence.",

Liposarcoma of the pleura can be combined with mediastinal involvement, and in most cases it may be impossible to be certain where the primary tumor originated. In this report, we describe a very rare occurence of a dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the pleura in a 76-year-old woman associated with a distinct second dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the mediastinum. Histologically, the pleural tumor demonstrated spindle cells arranged in a fascicular pattern, whereas the mediastinal tumor was mostly adipocytic with small areas of spindle cells. Vimentin and protein S100 were focally expressed by the tumor cells. The differential diagnosis of the pleural mass included malignant solitary fibrous tumor. Cytogenetic analysis showed supernumerary ring chromosomes in the pleural tumor, as well as strong amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 genes in both tumors. Array comparative genomic hybridization showed amplifications of chromosome arms 6q, 12q, and 15q, shared by both tumors and strongly pointing to a common origin.",

Histologic classification might be difficult, however, when liposarcoma demonstrates cartilaginous differentiation. Although this phenomenon has previously been noted, it has not, to our knowledge, been reported as a specific pathologic entity. All three patients in the present study were men, ages 37, 42, and 63 years. Each presented with a solitary, enlarging mass of the thigh that was surgically excised. The tumors ranged in size from 8 to 13 cm. Microscopically, each lesion displayed characteristic features of myxoid liposarcoma; in addition, all possessed discrete, rounded foci of mature-appearing hyaline cartilage. One case displayed small foci showing chondrocyte atypia. No other patterns of mesenchymal differentiation were present. All patients received postoperative radiation therapy. No recurrences or metastases have been identified (mean duration, 39 mo). Myxoid liposarcomas with cartilaginous differentiation are of importance because they might be misdiagnosed as malignant mesenchymoma. The latter, if not qualified as to histologic grade, might be presumed to be a biologically more aggressive lesion. In addition, these lesions must be distinguished from two benign processes: chondroid lipoma and extraskeletal chondroma with lipoblast-like cells. Additional studies of this uncommon variant of liposarcoma will be necessary to document further its status as a low-grade sarcoma.",

Sixty seven percent of the patients previously underwent one to three surgical procedures (laparotomy 3 cases, recurrence 9 cases). Tumors were resectable in all patients.

Therefore, the rare occurrence of cases with combined patterns of well-differentiated liposarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma designated as mixed-type liposarcoma pose a conceptual problem. Moreover, this feature may have consequences for treatment choice and prognosis. Here, we have dissected the molecular relation of tumor components in cases of mixed-type liposarcoma. On the basis of heterogeneous preoperative magnetic resonance image (MRI) features, eight cases of mixed-type liposarcoma were selected. Preoperative biopsy samples and resection specimens were analyzed including molecular and immunohistochemical analysis on all components. As controls, cases with homogeneous MRI features and uniform aspects of myxoid liposarcoma (n = 5), round cell liposarcoma (n = 5) and well-differentiated liposarcoma (n = 5) were studied. All patients with heterogeneous MRI features showed morphological components of myxoid liposarcoma and well-differentiated liposarcoma. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed FUS-DDIT3 fusion in both components in five of eight cases in the absence (zero of five) of MDM2 and CDK4 amplification. In three of eight patients, MDM2 and\\/or CDK4 were overexpressed, and amplification was shown by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in the absence of myxoid liposarcoma translocations. All control patients showed a molecular pattern consistent with their morphological features. Therefore, mixed-type liposarcomas should not be regarded as collision tumors, but as an extreme variant of the morphological spectrum within a single biological entity, explaining the biological contradiction of mixed-type liposarcoma. For treatment stratification, detailed classification including molecular support should be performed in tumors with heterogeneous MRI features.",

Liposarcoma is the most common malignant mesenchymal neoplasm in adults, although a mediastinal location is extremely rare. It has a large volume and varied histologic subtypes. It is characterized by the compression of neighboring structures. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide useful data for diagnosis. Tissue biopsy and histological typing are very important in determining the treatment and are needed for the final diagnosis. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are ineffective treatment modalities. According to the literature, surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Long-term follow-up evaluation is indicated since there is a high rate of recurrence.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of CDK4 expression by \\u03B4EF1 have not yet been elucidated. The present study demonstrated that the ectopic expression of \\u03B4EF1 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells significantly increased the activity of the CDK4 promoter. Deletion of the E2-box (CACGTG), which is located at position -197\\/-191 on the human CDK4 promoter, significantly attenuated the activation of CDK4 transcription by \\u03B4EF1. In addition, a CDK4 promoter-M construct was generated via site-directed mutagenesis of the E2-box on the human CDK4 promoter. Luciferase assay showed that the activation of CDK4 promoter-M activity by \\u03B4EF1 was markedly decreased compared with the CDK4-promoter-0.4k promoter. Knockdown of \\u03B4EF1 using RNA interference resulted in the inhibition of CDK4 promoter activity. These observations suggest that \\u03B4EF1 upregulates CDK4 transcription via the E2-box element on the CDK4 promoter.",

The patient was a 61-year-old man who presented with a soft-tissue mass of the left cheek and a presumptive diagnosis of salivary neoplasm based on a fine needle aspiration. The tumor was excised and consisted histologically of an atypical lipomatous tumor\\/well-differentiated liposarcoma composed a well-differentiated lipomatous neoplasm with atypical cells and rare lipoblasts. The tumor recurred in the same location 5 months after surgery. The recurrent tumor was primarily composed of a nonlipogenic spindle sarcoma with focal rhabdomyoblastic differentiation associated with areas of an atypical lipomatous tumor\\/well-differentiated liposarcoma.",

Pleural liposarcoma is a rare, highly malignant intrathoracic tumor arising from the soft tissue of the pleural cavity. Chest radiograph and CT scan revealed a homogeneous mass with subtotal opacification of the left hemithorax. Tumor diagnosis was based on histopathological examination of a transparietal biopsy and revealed a mixed type liposarcoma. Surgical resection was performed followed by adjuvant irradiation. No recurrence was diagnosed during the follow-up period of ten months and the patient continues to do well at the time of writing this paper.",

We have treated 47 cases of liposarcoma, comprising 35 males and 12 females ranging in age from 22 to 86 years, with a median age of 56 years. The most common site of primary tumor was the thigh, the most common primary tumor stage by the UICC classification was T2, and the most common histological subtype by the WHO classification was myxoid type. Xerography, CT and angiography are useful forms of examination for diagnosis before surgery. Naked eye findings of the tumor often show a lobular or nodular growth pattern. Surgical therapy for the primary tumor, especially curative wide resection (by the method of Kawaguchi, et al.) is most effective for preventing local recurrence. Radiotherapy is not as effective as for rhabdomyosarcoma and chemotherapy should be applied for occult micro-metastases. Ten of the 47 cases died due to distant metastases and the 5 year survival rate was 76.2%.",

Surgery and radiation therapy are the accepted treatments for most sarcomas; however, patients with metastatic disease are treated with systemic chemotherapy. Many tumors display marginal levels of chemoresponsiveness and new treatment approaches are needed. Deregulation of the G1 checkpoint is crucial for various oncogenic transformation processes, suggesting that many cancer cell types depend on CDK4\\/6 activity. Thus, CDK4\\/6 activity appears to represent a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment. In the present work, we explore the efficacy of CDK4 inhibition using palbociclib (PD0332991), a highly selective inhibitor of CDK4\\/6, in a panel of sarcoma cell lines and sarcoma tumor xenografts (PDXs). Palbociclib induces senescence in these cell lines and the responsiveness of these cell lines correlated with their levels of CDK4 mRNA. Palbociclib is also active in vivo against sarcomas displaying high levels of CDK4 but not against sarcomas displaying low levels of CDK4 and high levels of p16ink4a. The analysis of tumors growing after palbociclib showed a clear decrease in the CDK4 levels, indicating that clonal selection occurred in these treated tumors. In summary, our data support the efficacy of CDK4 inhibitors against sarcomas displaying increased CDK4 levels, particularly fibrosarcomas and MPNST. Our results also suggest that high levels of p16ink4a may indicate poor efficacy of CDK4 inhibitors.",

It does not metastasize but can dedifferentiate, acquiring metastatic potential. Hibernomas are benign neoplasms that show variable differentiation toward brown fat, and can sometimes occur in the abdomen or retroperitoneum. We illustrate a case of retroperitoneal WDL that showed extensive hibernoma-like morphology, with sheets of multivacuolated adipocytes of varying sizes, with abundant cytoplasm and numerous lipid vacuoles or granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. However, very focally there were fibrous septa containing spindle cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic, mildly pleomorphic nuclei. Further sampling showed areas of typical WDL, with lobules of mature fat intersected by fibrous septa containing atypical, enlarged spindle cells, as well as small foci of dedifferentiation. Immunohistochemistry for CDK4 and p16 showed strong and diffuse nuclear expression in the hibernoma-like areas, and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed MDM2 gene amplification, all in keeping with WDL. We highlight hibernoma-like morphology as part of the histologic spectrum of WDL, and recognition of this variant is important for correct treatment and prognostication.",

This study demonstrates that hyperthermic regional perfusion and excision are superior to wide excision or amputation in preventing local recurrence for a liposarcoma of the leg and allow salvage of a functional limb.",

Although it is very difficult to assess the prognosis and treatment of pharyngeal liposarcomas, it appears that the histologic characteristics of the individual tumor and its location and resectability determine the outcome of treatment. However, because of its rare occurrence clinically, no single institution has been able to gain enough experience to formulate reliable long-term prognoses and therapeutic guidelines.",

Whole-kidney and glomerular hypertrophy caused by hyperglycemia was associated with specific G1 phase cell-cycle events: early and sustained increase in expression of cyclin D1 and activation of cyclin D1-cdk4 complexes, but no change in expression of cyclin E or cdk2 activity. Overexpression of RB alone likewise caused hypertrophy and increased only cyclin D1-cdk4 activity; these effects were not further augmented by high glucose. Identical observations were made when isolated mesangial cells conditionally overexpressing RB from a tetracycline-repressible system hypertrophied in response to high glucose. A mitogenic signal in the same cell-culture system, in contrast, transiently and sequentially activated both cyclin D1-cdk4 and cyclin E-cdk2. In vivo and in cultured mesangial cells, high glucose resulted in persistent partial phosphorylation of RB, an event catalyzed specifically by cyclin D1-cdk4. These data indicate that mesangial hypertrophy caused by hyperglycemia in diabetes results in sustained cyclin D1-cdk4-dependent phosphorylation of RB and maintenance of mesangial cells in the early-to-middle G1 phase of the cell cycle.",

Because of their frequent deregulation in cancer, cyclin D-CDK4\\/6 complexes are emerging as especially promising therapeutic targets. The specific CDK4\\/6 inhibitor PD0332991 is currently tested in a growing number of phase II\\/III clinical trials against a variety of pRb-proficient chemotherapy-resistant cancers. We have previously shown that PD0332991 inhibits not only CDK4\\/6 activity but also the activation by phosphorylation of the bulk of cyclin D-CDK4 complexes stabilized by p21 binding. Here we show that PD0332991 has either a positive or a negative impact on the activation of cyclin D-CDK4\\/6 complexes, depending on their binding to p21. Indeed, whereas PD0332991 inhibits the phosphorylation and activity of p21-bound CDK4\\/6, it specifically stabilized activated cyclin D3-CDK4\\/6 complexes devoid of p21 and p27. After elimination of PD0332991, these activated cyclin D3-CDK4\\/6 complexes persisted for at least 24 h, resulting in paradoxical cell cycle entry in the absence of a mitogenic stimulation. This unsuspected positive effect of PD0332991 on cyclin D3-CDK4\\/6 activation should be carefully assessed in the clinical evaluation of PD0332991, which until now only involves discontinuous administration protocols.",

Both the synthesis and assembly of D-type cyclins and cdk4 depend upon serum stimulation, but even when both subunits are ectopically overproduced, they do not assemble into complexes in serum-deprived cells. When coexpressed from baculoviral vectors in intact Sf9 insect cells, cdk4 assembles with D-type cyclins to form active protein kinases. In contrast, recombinant D-type cyclin and cdk4 subunits produced in insect cells or in bacteria do not assemble as efficiently into functional holoenzymes when combined in vitro but can be activated in the presence of lysates obtained from proliferating mammalian cells. Assembly of cyclin D-cdk4 complexes in coinfected Sf9 cells facilitates phosphorylation of cdk4 on threonine 172 by a cdk-activating kinase (CAK). Assembly can proceed in the absence of this modification, but cdk4 mutants which cannot be phosphorylated by CAK remain catalytically inactive. Therefore, formation of the cyclin D-cdk4 complex and phosphorylation of the bound catalytic subunit are independently regulated, and in addition to the requirement for CAK activity, serum stimulation is required to promote assembly of the complexes in mammalian cells.",

The mean chromosome number per cell is 36, with several constant markers, the most conspicuous of which is a large submetacentric marker due to a translocation between chromosomes 4 and 11, which is present in every cell. The liposarcoma cells show an enhanced uptake of [14C]acetate compared to normal human fibroblasts.",

The examination on admission including IVP, echography, Ga scintigraphy, barium enema, CT scan, and angiography revealed that the right kidney and ascending colon were displaced by the mass. Under the diagnosis of retroperitoneal tumor, operation was carried out. Most of the mass was resected with the right kidney. The pathological diagnosis of the resected tumor revealed well differentiated liposarcoma. Convalescence was uneventful and the patient has been well and free from disease for 14 months. Based on our experience and the review of the pertinent literature in English and Japanese, we emphasize the importance of definite surgery and close follow up, as liposarcoma is frequently recurrent.",

CCNDI and CDK4 gene alterations have been implicated in the development of different tumors. CCND1 has been associated with progression in laryngeal carcinomas. CDK4 protein overexpression was described associated to CCND 1 overexpression in these tumors. However, the mechanisms implicated were not known. We analyzed CDK4 gene alterations and mRNA expression in a series of carcinomas of the larynx, and the results were compared to CCND1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of the patients. CDK4 mRNA was overexpressed in 42 out of 60 tumors (70%) associated with CCND1 mRNA overexpression because 15 out of 16 cases with high CCND1 levels showed simultaneous increased levels of CDK4 mRNA (p = 0.023) and 12 (87%) of the tumors overexpressing both genes were in stage 4. No CDK4 gene amplifications, rearrangements, or mutations were detected in any of the tumors, including 24 overexpressed cases. These findings confirm that CDK4 overexpression is a frequent phenomenon in laryngeal carcinomas, which occurs at the transcriptional level but is related neither to gene amplification nor to gene mutation, and suggest that cooperation with CCND1 may be involved in the progression of laryngeal tumors.",

In addition, we screened a panel of melanoma cells with a highly selective CDK4\\/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 (PD-991) and performed gene expression and mutation analysis on these cells to explore possible genomic predictors of sensitivity.Genomic analysis revealed that 75% of primary melanomas had at least one CNV in the CDK4 pathway, with 55% showing a loss of CDKN2A. 28% of melanomas had two or more CNVs and melanomas with two or more CNVs involving CCND1 had worse overall survival (HR 5.56, P=0.02). From the cell line studies low CDKN2A mRNA expression, mutation or loss predicted sensitivity to PD-991 with 23 out of 27 mutant\\/loss cell lines being sensitive compared to only 3\\/7 wild type lines (p<0.03). Expression of CDK4, CCND1 or other cyclins or CDK-inhibitors did not predict sensitivity to PD-991. PD-991 induced an increase in both cell size and SA--galactosidase activity that is indicative of a senescent phenotype, and this was associated with cells having wild type p53. In summary, genomic alterations in the CDK4 pathway are frequent in melanoma and are associated with worse survival, particularly when melanomas harbor two or more CNVs involving CCND1. CDK4 inhibition induces a senescent phenotype in melanoma cells that is associated with loss of CDKN2A and wild type TP53. Taken together these data support evaluation of CDK4 inhibitors in melanoma and suggest that CDKN2A and TP53 maybe genomic predictors of sensitivity."

The patient had first recognized a very soft mass in the anterolateral part of the right thigh more than 20 years earlier, but because the tumor showed little change over this period, she did not seek treatment. She recently noticed a hard, rapidly growing mass within the former tumor. Both magnetic resonance imaging and axial computed tomography revealed a subcutaneous fatty lesion measuring 12 x 7 x 4 cm and a well-delineated mass-like area (4 x 3 x 3 cm) of nonfatty tissue within the lesion. Histologically, the former was a mature lipomatous tumor with broad fibrous septa containing some atypical stromal cells, and the latter was a much more cellular, spindle cell tumor with a malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like pattern. The authors propose that dedifferentiated liposarcoma is not restricted to the deep soft tissues and may develop in the subcutis and further suggest appropriate surgical management for well-differentiated fatty tumors of subcutaneous origin.",

Pelvic CT and MRI showed a heterogeneous tumor in the retrovesical region. Transperineal biopsy revealed liposarcoma. Pelvic exenteration, colostomy and ileal conduit were performed. The resected weight was 1,680 grams, and the histopathological diagnosis was myxoid type of liposarcoma, grade II. Postoperatively, a metastatic lesion to vertebrae thoracicae I developed causing radiculoneuropathy of the left superior limb. Spot radiation (50 Gy) was administered to the lesion, but there was no response.

                    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) substrate 2 (FRS2) is an adaptor protein that plays a critical role in FGFR signaling. FRS2 is located on chromosome 12q13-15 that is frequently amplified in liposarcomas. The significance of FRS2 and FGFR signaling in high-grade liposarcomas is unknown. Herein, we first comparatively examined the amplification and expression of FRS2 with CDK4 and MDM2 in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) and undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (UHGPS). Amplification and expression of the three genes were identified in 90% to 100% (9-11 of 11) of DDLS, whereas that of FRS2, CDK4, and MDM2 were observed in 55% (41 of 75), 48% (36 of 75), and 44% (33\\/75) of clinically diagnosed UHGPS, suggesting that these \\\"UHGPS\\\" may represent DDLS despite lacking histologic evidence of lipoblasts. Immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated FRS2 protein indicated that the FGFR\\/FRS2 signaling axis was generally activated in about 75% of FRS2-positive high-grade liposarcomas. Moreover, we found that FRS2 and FGFRs proteins are highly expressed and functional in three high-grade liposarcoma cell lines: FU-DDLS-1, LiSa-2, and SW872. Importantly, the FGFR selective inhibitor NVP-BGJ-398 significantly inhibited the growth of FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells with a concomitant suppression of FGFR signal transduction. Attenuation of FRS2 protein in FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cell lines decreased the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1\\/2 and AKT and repressed cell proliferation. These findings indicate that analysis of FRS2 in combination with CDK4 and MDM2 will more accurately characterize pathologic features of high-grade liposarcomas. Activated FGFR\\/FRS2 signaling may play a functional role in the development of high-grade liposarcomas, therefore, serve as a potential therapeutic target.",

A 69-year-old Caucasian female presented with recurrent superficial phlebitis of left leg, which responded only partially to conventional therapy. Following investigations, a mass was excised. Diagnosis of pleomorphic liposarcoma was made on microscopic examination. Numerous lipid droplets in the cytoplasm and often within intranuclear extensions of cytoplasm were seen on oil red O stain of frozen sections. Ultrastructural features are quite distinctive. The cells varied from small to often large pleomorphic cells with numerous lipid spaces without limiting membrane, large pleomorphic nuclei, and an abundance of cytoplasmic organelles. Centrioles were very prominent, in close proximity to nuclei, and collections of autophagocytic inclusions. Intercellular collagen was immature and scant. These features are compared to ultrastructural features of malignant fibrous histiocytoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, and cardiac myxoma, indicating that ultrastructural features are distinctive and help differentiate similar soft tissue tumors.",

The tumor underwent completely resection and histopathological analysis revealed the tumor to be a pleomorphic liposarcoma, which was composed predominantly of epithelioid cells.

Four patients diagnosed of liposarcoma are shown up, a case of liposarcoma well differentiated, another case of liposarcoma pleomorphic and two cases about liposarcoma mixoide; with the characteristic that one of these two cases presented a local recidivation with a dediferenciation of itself.

Clinically, all of the tumors arose in adults and developed around the shoulder girdle or upper limbs; all but one arose in subcutaneous tissue. Three patients developed multiple local recurrences over a period of 4-20 years. Recurrences in one case were purely lipoma-like. Following dedifferentiation in a recurrence, one patient developed distant metastases and eventually died, 46 months after the primary excision. Grossly, these lesions are characterized by multinodularity, and microscopically they show a relatively bland spindle cell proliferation arranged in fascicles and whorls and set in a variably myxoid stroma. The spindle cell areas are accompanied by an adipocytic component, which exhibits the morphologic features required for inclusion in the well-differentiated liposarcoma-atypical lipoma group, including definite lipoblasts. Main differential diagnoses include benign lesions such as spindle cell lipoma and diffuse neurofibroma, as well as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and other malignancies such as sclerosing liposarcoma, low-grade myxofibrosarcoma, low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. In view of their distinctive histologic appearance, and because aggressive clinical behavior was observed despite their superficial location, we propose that these lesions be regarded as spindle cell variants of well-differentiated liposarcoma.",

The serine-threonine kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) works in a complex with D-type cyclins to phosphorylate RB, mediating the entry of cells into the cell cycle in response to external stimuli. Because cdk4 is an upstream regulator of the E2F-RB pathway, we tested whether cdk4 was a target for new factors that regulate adipogenesis. Here we find that cdk4 inhibition impairs adipocyte differentiation and function. Disruption of cdk4 or activating mutations in cdk4 in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in reduced and increased adipogenic potential, respectively, of these cells. We show that the effects of cdk4 are not limited to the control of differentiation; cdk4 also participates in adipocyte function through activation of PPARgamma.",

Occurrence of dedifferentiated liposarcoma in the anterior mediastinum is rare. We did not perform any adjuvant therapy. Three years after the surgery, the patient is alive without disease. In lipoma-like, well-differentiated liposarcoma cases, we should consider the possibility of dedifferentiated liposarcoma if a mild, atypical spindle cell component is found.",

An 81-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a large asymptomatic splenic tumor. The patient underwent splenectomy, and the adipose tissue surrounding the splenic hilum was also resected. Microscopically, the tumor mainly consisted of high-grade spindle cells similar to those seen in undifferentiated pleomorphic liposarcoma. In the splenic hilum, scattered atypical cells were detected in the sclerosing component and adipose tissue. Immunohistochemically, both the spindle cells in the spleen and the atypical cells in the splenic hilum were positive for MDM2 and CDK4. The histopathologic diagnosis was dedifferentiated liposarcoma derived from an atypical lipomatous tumor\\/well-differentiated liposarcoma of the adipose tissue in the splenic hilum with extension into the spleen. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma in the spleen and splenic hilum should be considered as a differential diagnosis of splenic tumors.",

There were 13 patients in the group treated with various combinations of surgery and radiotherapy. The histology has been reviewed: 7 patients had myxoid tumours, 2 well differentiated and 4 pleomorphic. The patients were followed up for between 18-109 months with 7 patients followed for more than 5 years. Local recurrence was seen only in myxoid tumours whereas pleomorphic tumours showed a high incidence of distant metastases. The length of survival was found to correlate with the histology, pleomorphic tumours being associated with the shortest survival. The series illustrates that the histological type of liposarcoma predicts the pattern of behaviour of the tumour and is the major determinant in prognosis.",

The early clinical symptoms of these malignancies are unclear non specific and for this reason the disease is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. The prognosis of these lesions is generally poor owing to the diffusion of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Usually small bowel neoplasms are preoperatively identified only in 27-72%. The percentage of surgical removal is from 65 to 80% according to the recent literature. Aim of this paper is to present a rare case of jejunal liposarcoma.",

A laryngeal lineal tomography showed a subglottic obstruction due to extrinsic compression. The patient was referred to the Gastroenterology Department, where an upper gastrointestinal (upper GI) series demonstrated mega-esophagus with abundant retained food. Endoscopy showed a large intraluminal mass covered by normal mucosa which arose on the posterior wall. Videofluoroscopy and chest CT diagnosed a probable polypoid lipoma due to its densitometric characteristics. The tumour was resected by left cervicotomy and left esophagotomy. The patient's progress to date is favourable. Pathology studies showed a well-differentiated liposarcoma.

The treatment of choice remains radical orchidectomy with wide excision of the tumor. Because of the predilection of this lesion for local recurrence, the patients must be followed periodically.",

It commonly occurs in the extremities with extrapulmonary metastatic potential. Round cell liposarcoma, recently, is widely agreed to be the aggressive counterpart of the myxoid liposarcoma, mostly arising in adverse, local recurrence, and metastatic lesions. Metastatic liposarcoma with pure myxoid element is unusual. The authors report an extremely rare case of a 47-year-old Thai male patient having a metastatic pure myxoid liposarcoma to the thoracic vertebrae, one year after primary tumor documented on the left thigh. Histology of the primary and metastatic sites shows only myxoid pattern. Round cell feature was not documented. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the second case report of metastatic myxoid liposarcoma without round cell morphology.",

The patient had decreased appetite with epigastric discomfort and abdominal distension. Physical examination was initially normal with mainly normal tension and no abdominal or lombar mass in palpation. While hospitalised, she developed paroxystic crisis of flush, headaches and hypertension of 190\\/100 mmHg. Biological findings revealed hypokaliemia and normal kaliuria on 3 day samples, with normal glycaemia and normal creatininaemia. Hormonal investigation revealed elevated metanephrines (3 mg\\/24 hours). Magnetic resonance imaging showed an 11 cm x 8.5 cm retroperitoneal mass with an enhanced signal in T2, a hypotrophic non-functional left kidney and no adrenal adenoma. Clinical and hormonal features suggested a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. After preoperative medication, open excision, including left radical nephrectomy and adrenalectomy, normalized the catecholamine urinary level, resolved hypokalemia, and improved hypertension. Pathologic examination revealed a well-differentiated liposarcoma, without any pheochromocytoma component, and left adrenal hyperplasia. The tumour cells were immunonegative for chromogranin A. No metastatic lesion was identified by thoraco-abdominal computed tomography.",

The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) governs a key cell-cycle checkpoint that normally prevents G1-phase cells from entering S-phase in the absence of appropriate mitogenic signals. Cancer cells frequently overcome pRb-dependent growth suppression via constitutive phosphorylation and inactivation of pRb function by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 or CDK6 partnered with D-type cyclins. Three selective CDK4\\/6 inhibitors, palbociclib (Ibrance; Pfizer), ribociclib (Novartis), and abemaciclib (Lilly), are in various stages of development in a variety of pRb-positive tumor types, including breast cancer, melanoma, liposarcoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. The emerging, positive clinical data obtained to date finally validate the two decades-old hypothesis that the cyclin D-CDK4\\/6 pathway is a rational target for cancer therapy.",

Accordingly, immunohistochemical features and chromosomal alterations are used for its confirmatory diagnosis. However, cytogenetic analysis has not been performed for oesophageal liposarcoma. We studied chromosomal alterations using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), as well as endoscopic, radiological, H&E-stained and immunohistochemical features in the oesophageal well-differentiated liposarcoma of a 67-year-old man. Array CGH analysis revealed the presence of high-level amplifications at chromosomal locations 1p12-1q21.2, 12q13.2-12q15 and 12q21.33-12q23.1. At least 29 genes were highly amplified (log(2) ratio >2), among which CDK4 and MDM2 were the most highly amplified (log(2) ratio >4) and were accepted as major target genes. Moreover, the amplification of AMDHD1, HAL and LTA4H (log(2) ratio = 3.153) was a novel finding. This case suggests the presence of a characteristic profile of gene amplification in well-differentiated liposarcoma of the oesophagus. The amplified genes may be of pathogenic importance for primary oesophageal well-differentiated liposarcoma.",

Both high-grade and low-grade dedifferentiation have been reported. Herein, we presented a unique case of a 64-year-old man with low-grade dedifferentiated liposarcoma with prominent myxoid stroma. Well-differentiated liposarcoma components extended along the spermatic cord. The constituent cells of the dedifferentiated component were peculiar in that, they were relatively uniform cells with atypia and did not have pleomorphism to such an extent that it mimicked myxofibrosarcoma. This myxoid component was confidently differentiated from myxoid liposarcoma with the help of immunohistochemical analysis using CDK4 and MDM2. These two markers were also expressed in the well-differentiated component. It could therefore be confirmed that this sarcoma is dedifferentiated liposarcoma but is not mixed-type liposarcoma comprising well-differentiated liposarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma.",

This was the 3rd largest retroperitoneal malignant tumor that was successfully removed according to the available literature of the last five decades. These typically symptom-free tumors usually grow extreme size before diagnosed. The \\\"gold-standard\\\" of treatment remains surgical total excision, but the high local recurrence rate (50-60%) hopefully can be reduced by adjuvant radio- and chemotherapy.

Distinguishing atypical lipomatous tumor-well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDL) from benign adipocytic neoplasms and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL) from pleomorphic or myxoid liposarcoma (LPS) can be difficult. WDL and DDL characteristically harbor amplifications of the MDM2 and CDK4 cell cycle oncogenes with protein overexpression and can also overexpress the cell cycle regulator p16. We assessed the utility of immunohistochemistry for CDK4, MDM2, and p16 in the routine histopathologic diagnosis of WDL\\/DDL from other adipocytic tumors. Immunohistochemistry for the trio of markers was performed on 216 adipocytic neoplasms (31 WDLs, 57 DDLs, 11 myxoid LPS, 2 pleomorphic LPS, 91 lipomas (including intramuscular, fibro, angio, and ossifying subtypes), 18 spindle\\/pleomorphic lipomas, and 6 hibernomas. Sixty-eight percent of WDLs and 72% of DDLs expressed all 3 antigens, whereas 100% of WDLs and 93% of DDLs expressed at least 2 antigens. The sensitivity and specificity of the trio for detecting WDLs\\/DDLs were 71% and 98%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of CDK4 for detecting WDLs\\/DDLs were 86% and 89%, those of MDM2 were 86% and 74%, and those of p16 were 93% and 92%, respectively. The immunohistochemical trio of CDK4, MDM2, and p16 is a useful ancillary diagnostic tool that provides strong support in distinguishing WDLs and DDLs from other adipocytic neoplasms and is potentially more sensitive than previously assessed combinations of CDK4 and MDM2. p16 was the most sensitive and specific marker for detecting WDL\\/DDL, and the combination of CDK4 and p16 is of more discriminatory value than the combination of either with MDM2, the least sensitive and specific of the 3 markers.",

The former patient died from metastases 10 months after presentation, the latter remains alive but has developed metastatic disease on follow up at 24 months.We recommend the use of high dose radiotherapy following radical surgery as margins of excision are usually narrow in this most difficult region.

This mutation, R24C, renders the Cdk4 protein insensitive to inhibition by INK4 proteins including p16(INK4a), a major candidate for the melanoma susceptibility locus. Here we show that knock-in mice expressing a Cdk4 R24C allele are highly susceptible to melanoma development after specific carcinogenic treatments. These tumors do not have mutations in the p19(ARF)\\/p53 pathway, suggesting a specific involvement of the p16(INK4a)\\/Cdk4\\/Rb pathway in melanoma development. Moreover, by using targeted mice deficient for other INK4 inhibitors, we show that deletion of p18(INK4c) but not of p15(INK4b) confers proliferative advantage to melanocytic tumor growth. These results provide an experimental scenario to study the role of Cdk4 regulation in melanoma and to develop novel therapeutic approaches to control melanoma progression.",

We report a case of liposarcoma of the renal sinus that extended into the renal venous lumen. A 58-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for an intravascular fatty tumor of the right renal vein incidentally discovered by an abdominal screening ultrasonogram. Computer tomography revealed a fatty tumor extending from the right kidney to the right renal vein with no evidence of metastatic lesions. Total right nephrectomy and extirpation of the intravascular tumor of the right renal vein were carried out. Pathological findings showed well-differentiated liposarcoma of the renal sinus. The tumor invaded to the right renal vein and the renal parenchyma.",

Liposarcomas show a variety of radiographic features in terms of histological types and tumor sizes, so the specific diagnosis of liposarcoma is often difficult. We present a unique case of perinephric dedifferentiated liposarcoma mimicking cystic renal tumor. A 71-year-old man presented himself at our hospital with a palpable mass in his upper right abdomen. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) revealed a well-defined cystic mass at the lower pole of the right kidney that contained heterogeneous solid components and small foci of fat. There were no signs of lymphadenopathy or tumor thrombus in the renal vein. Metastatic evaluation by chest x-ray and bone scan was negative. The probable diagnosis was cystic renal cell carcinoma or atypical angiomyolipoma. Because we could not exclude the possibility of cystic malignancy, a right radical nephrectomy was performed. Grossly, the tumor was predominantly encapsulated by a unilocular fibrous capsule and was filled with bloody fluid and debris. The anterior portion of the tumor was composed of various-sized soft and rubbery masses covered with necrotic tissue. The histological diagnosis was dedifferentiated liposarcoma arising in the perinephric retroperitoneum with extensive necrosis, and the cyst wall was composed of a necrotic tumor with a well differentiated liposarcoma and a fibrous capsule. Although the tumor widely covered the right kidney, there was no microscopic invasion of the kidney. No signs of tumor recurrence were noted six months after the operation.",

Histologically, liposarcomas themselves are heterogeneous and fall into four distinct subtypes: well-differentiated\\/atypical lipomatous tumor, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, myxoid (round cell) liposarcoma, and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Surgical resection with negative margins remains the mainstay for definitive treatment for operable disease. For unresectable disease, retrospective studies have identified myxoid (round cell) and pleomorphic sarcomas to be relatively responsive to chemotherapy. Recent studies have identified distinct genetic aberrations that not only aid in the diagnosis of particular liposarcoma subtypes, but represent actionable targets as they are considered central to disease pathogenesis. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and murine double minute 2 (MDM2) are overexpressed in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas and offer tantalizing opportunities that are being pursued in clinical trials. Myxoid (round cell) liposarcomas appear to be sensitive to trabectedin, which is currently under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review. Liposarcomas do not represent a uniform disease and understanding the underlying molecular mechanism will help not only in accurate diagnosis but in selecting the appropriate treatment.",

Since mice lacking Cdk4, Cdk6 or Cdk2 are viable, it has been proposed that they play compensatory roles. We report here that mice lacking Cdk4 and Cdk2 complete embryonic development to die shortly thereafter presumably due to heart failure. However, conditional ablation of Cdk2 in adult mice lacking Cdk4 does not result in obvious abnormalities. Moreover, these double mutant mice recover normally after partial hepatectomy. In culture, Cdk4(-\\/-);Cdk2(-\\/-) embryonic fibroblasts become immortal, display robust pRb phosphorylation and have normal S phase kinetics. These observations indicate that Cdk4 and Cdk2 are dispensable for the mammalian cell cycle and for adult homeostasis.",

In this study, we have investigated the susceptibility to skin tumor formation by forced expression of CDK4. Skin tumors from transgenic mice showed a dramatic increase in the rate of malignant progression to squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) in an initiation-promotion protocol. Histopathological analysis of papillomas from transgenic mice showed an elevated number of premalignant lesions characterized by dysplasia and marked atypia. Interestingly, transgenic mice also developed tumors in initiated but not promoted skin, demonstrating that CDK4 replaced the action of tumor promoters. These results suggest that expression of cyclin D1 upon ras activation synergizes with CDK4 overexpression. However, cyclin D1 transgenic mice and double transgenic mice for cyclin D1 and CDK4 did not show increased malignant progression in comparison to CDK4 transgenic mice. Biochemical analysis of tumors showed that CDK4 sequesters the CDK2 inhibitors p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, suggesting that indirect activation of CDK2 plays an important role in tumor development. These results indicate that, contrary to the general assumption, the catalytic subunit, CDK4, has higher oncogenic activity than cyclin D1, revealing a potential use of CDK4 as therapeutic target.",

It is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the retroperitoneum. It is detected at very late stages especially when the tumor gains substantial size, weight of several pounds at the time of diagnosis because it is grows very silently in deep tissues in the retroperitoneal area. Therefore, most of the patients with liposarcoma have no symptoms until the tumor is getting very large and pressurizes on neighboring structures which causes tenderness, pain, or functional disturbances. A 61 year-old male patient admitted with one-year history of abdominal pain, distention. Computed tomography demonstrated a large retroperitoneal mass in fat density filling the pelvic cavity extending to epigastric region especially in the left side of abdomen, and displacing intestines to the right and left kidney and pancreas gland posteriorly. At laparotomy the retroperitoneal tumor weighed 13.2 kg, Histologically it was a well-differentiated liposarcoma. Total extirpation surgery is still the most effective treatment in well-differentiated liposarcomas. Close follow-up after surgery is mandotary due to high rates of recurrence (Fig. 3, Ref. 10).

Excision revealed the mass to be a well differentiated liposarcoma, and after further consultation, the left hallux was amputated. Although the incidence of differentiated liposarcoma in the foot is rare, the preceding case should reiterate to all the need for closer investigation of soft tissue masses which may appear in the foot. Prompt excision of malignant tumors results in a good prognosis for the patients, whereas misdiagnosis based on the apparently benign appearance may lead to unnecessary delay and a less fortuitous prognosis for the patient.",

It is a rare condition and occurs generally in the 4th and 6th decades of life. Renal liposarcomas are clinically asymptomatic for a long period of time. Symptoms develop only when the tumours become large enough, as in our case. For the differential diagnosis of renal liposarcoma we performed intravenous urography, computerized tomography and colour flow Doppler ultrasonography. After these diagnostic evaluations the patient underwent right radical nephrectomy. Complete surgical resection was performed. Final diagnosis was made by pathological examination. Because of the poor results of either chemotherapy or radiotherapy, we conclude that 42 months of tumour-free survival is related to complete surgical resection with negative surgical margins.",

This is a rare tumour (about one hundred cases have been reported in the literature), which essentially arises from the spermatic cord. Clinical and radiological signs are nonspecific and the diagnosis is generally based on histological examination of the operative specimen. Due to the histological similarities, all specimens of benign lipoma must be examined for the presence of well differentiated liposarcoma. Treatment consists of transinguinal radical orchidectomy, sometimes with resection of adjacent structures. The prognosis is generally better than that of other paratesticular sarcomas. Adjuvant radiotherapy may be indicated in locally advanced masses or in the case of incomplete resection.",

Addition of p34(SEI-1) to cyclin D1-CDK4 renders the complex resistant to inhibition by p16(INK4a). Expression of SEI-1 is rapidly induced on addition of serum to quiescent fibroblasts, and ectopic expression of p34(SEI-1) enables fibroblasts to proliferate even in low serum concentrations. p34(SEI-1) seems to act as a growth factor sensor and may facilitate the formation and activation of cyclin D-CDK complexes in the face of inhibitory levels of INK4 proteins.",

However, if the lipogenic component is not abundant due to surgical sampling or small biopsy, dedifferentiated liposarcoma can be difficult to distinguish from other poorly different sarcomas. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a nuclear hormone receptor that plays a critical role in adipocyte differentiation. Prior studies have not only demonstrated PPAR-gamma mRNA in various subtypes of liposarcoma but have also shown that adipocyte differentiation can be induced in some liposarcomas by a PPAR-gamma agonist. In the present study, we investigated whether immunostaining for PPAR-gamma can be used to distinguish dedifferentiated liposarcoma from other retroperitoneal sarcomas. We examined a series of 40 dedifferentiated liposarcoma and compared the staining for PPAR-gamma to a series of 24 retroperitoneal sarcomas that lacked lipogenic differentiation. A monoclonal antibody against PPAR-gamma was used to stain formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Specific nuclear immunostaining was present in 37\\/40 (93%) of the dedifferentiated liposarcoma and 6\\/24 (25%) of the other sarcomas (two leiomyosarcomas and four undifferentiated sarcomas). Interestingly, immunostaining for CDK4 and\\/or MDM2 was identified in three of the four PPAR-gamma-positive undifferentiated sarcomas, raising the possibility that these may represent dedifferentiated liposarcoma. This is the first study demonstrating the utility of PPAR-gamma immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma in tissue sections. Although not completely specific, the presence of PPAR-gamma staining, in combination with histologic findings and other markers, can aid in the diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, particularly on small biopsies that may not sample the well-differentiated component.",

The exact functional mechanism by which CDC37 promotes this association, however, remains unknown. CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle. We have detected a specific association of CDK4 with the molecular chaperon HSP90 and a 44-kDa protein that we identify as mammalian CDC37. A physical interaction between CDC37 and CDK4 suggests that CDC37 may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on CDK4. Association of CDK4 with both CDC37 and HSP90 may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of CDC37 and HSP90.",

Otoscopy revealed debris in the attic. We performed tympanoplasty for recurrent cholesteatoma. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was well-differentiated liposarcoma. Palliative resection of liposarcoma was performed 3 months after the first surgery. Neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis has been detected for 24 months after the first surgery. The favorable outcome in this patient was probably due to the histological type of his liposarcoma.",

All cases of paratesticular liposarcomas were retrieved from the archives of the Royal Marsden Hospital and the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Slides were reviewed and clinical information obtained. There were 30 paratesticular liposarcomas from men aged 41-87 years (mean 63 years; median 65 years) that involved the spermatic cord (23, 76%), testicular tunics (6, 20%), and epididymis (1, 4%). Tumors ranged from 3 to 30 cm (mean 11.7 cm; median 10 cm). Nineteen were well-differentiated liposarcomas (WDLs) and 10 were dedifferentiated liposarcomas (DDLs, five with high-grade and five with low-grade dedifferentiation). One was a myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma with 70% round cell areas. All patients were treated by radical orchiectomy. One patient with WDL received radiation after his second recurrence and the myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma received radiation and chemotherapy. Follow-up information was available for 16 of the patients, including 10 WDLs (range 24-216 months, mean 106 months), 5 DDLs (14-30 months, median 24 months), and for the myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma (14 months) (range for all cases 14 months to 22 years; mean 87 months, median 36 months). Six of the WDLs (60%) recurred at 2, 4, 6, 10, 18, and 21 years (median 8 years). The lesion that recurred at 18 years (case no. 6) displayed foci of high-grade dedifferentiation in the recurrence, although the patient was disease free at 19 years. One patient with WDL had two recurrences at 4 and 7 years, and another had six recurrences over a 17-year period. Only one example of DDL recurred, at 30 months; another patient, who refused therapy for 15 years, had a primary tumor 30 cm in diameter, displayed pulmonary metastases 1 month after excision, and died after 14 months. The patient with MRCL had abdominal metastases after 1 year and was alive at 14 months. In summary, paratesticular WDL had a prolonged course with recurrences in more than half the cases, sometimes late. There were no metastases and the overall prognosis was good. One DDL recurred and only one of five (20%) developed metastases, but the mean follow-up for DDL was only 24 months.",

Dysregulation of the cyclin D-CDK4\\/6-INK4-Rb pathway results in increased proliferation, and is frequently observed in many types of cancer. Pathway activation can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including gene amplification or rearrangement, loss of negative regulators, epigenetic alterations, and point mutations in key pathway components. Due to the importance of CDK4\\/6 activity in cancer cells, CDK4\\/6 inhibitors have emerged as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Moreover, combination of a CDK4\\/6 inhibitor with other targeted therapies may help overcome acquired or de novo treatment resistance. Ongoing studies include combinations of CDK4\\/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancers, and with selective RAF and MEK inhibitors for tumors with alterations in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway such as melanoma. In particular, the combination of CDK4\\/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy, such as palbociclib's recent first-line approval in combination with letrozole, is expected to transform the treatment of HR+ breast cancer. Currently, three selective CDK4\\/6 inhibitors have been approved or are in late-stage development: palbociclib (PD-0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and abemaciclib (LY2835219). Here we describe the current preclinical and clinical data for these novel agents and discuss combination strategies with other agents for the treatment of cancer.",

In complex with cyclin D, CDK4 phosphorylates retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and drives cell-cycle progression, a process inhibited by p16. The p16-CDK4-cyclin D-Rb is aberrant in the majority of cancers and is, thus, a logical target for anticancer therapy. Previous attempts to block CDK4 with nonselective cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors led to toxicity and little efficacy. However, the recent development of selective CDK4 inhibitors launched the first successful efforts to target the pathway for cancer therapy. Three oral selective CDK4 inhibitors have entered clinical trials: palbociclib (PD0332991), LEE011, and LY2835219. CDK4 inhibitors have in vitro activity against a broad range of cancers and in patients have shown antitumor activity in breast cancer, lymphoma, sarcoma, and other tumors. Major efforts are under way to develop biomarkers of response, understand potential mechanisms of resistance, and develop rational combinations of CDK4 inhibitors with chemotherapy and other targeted drugs.",

It tends to occur equally in the retroperitoneum or the limbs followed by the paratesticular area and the mediastinum, with a peak incidence between the fifth and the seventh decades. WD liposarcoma is further subdivided in the adipocytic (lipoma-like), sclerosing, inflammatory, and spindle cell subtypes, of which the first two are by far the commoner. WD adipocytic liposarcoma is composed of a relatively mature adipocytic proliferation, featuring cell size variation as well as at least focal nuclear atypia. A varying number (from many to none) of lipoblasts may be found. Sclerosing WD liposarcoma is characterized microscopically by the presence of scattered distinctive bizarre stromal cells and multivacuolated lipoblasts set in a fibrillary collagenous background. Inflammatory liposarcoma represents a rare variant of WD liposarcoma in which a chronic inflammatory infiltrate predominates to the extent that the differential diagnosis is mainly with nonadipocytic lesions such as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, Castleman's disease, and Hodgkin's as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Spindle cell liposarcoma is the rarest variant and is composed neural-like spindle cell proliferation set in a fibrous and\\/or myxoid background and associated with an atypical lipomatous component which usually includes lipoblasts. Cytogenetically, WD liposarcoma appears to be relatively homogenous exhibiting characteristic ring as well as giant marker chromosomes containing amplified genetic material derived from the 12q13-15 chromosome region. As WD liposarcomas of any type have no potential for metastasis unless they undergo dedifferentiation, the opportunity to replace the term \\\"WD liposarcoma\\\" with a less frightening denomination has produced a long, sharp debate. WD liposarcoma and atypical lipoma should be considered as synonyms and their use should therefore be determined by the degree of reciprocal comprehension between the surgeon and the pathologist to prevent either inadequate or excessive treatment.",

A review of the literature showed seven case reports of lipoblastoma karyotype, six of which had a similar breakpoint in chromosome 8. This distinguishes it from the histologically alike myxoid liposarcoma, the karyotype of which typically contains the clonal anomaly t(12;16)(q13:p11).

We diagnosed the growth as a right inguinal hernia and operated on him. The growth, however, was found to be a tumor it situated along the spermatic cord and testicular vessels. We diagnosed it as a lipoma. The tumor was resected near part of the internal inguinal ring. Histopathological diagnosis showed well-differentiated liposarcoma of the sclerosing type. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) revealed a large residual tumor in the retroperitoneum. We believed that the tumor was a retroperitoneal liposarcoma and that it developed in the inguinal region. The residue of the liposarcoma was resected onto the right inguinal tract. A periodic follow up has been performed and no evidence of recurrence or metastasis has been seen in the 4 years and 9 months since the second surgery. No adjuvant therapy was performed. Inguinal liposarcomas are relatively rare and in most cases these tumors are thought to originate in the spermatic cord. The origin of the tumor is believed to be the retroperitoneum.",

Our case report underlines the possibility of discovering this type of tumor by means of mammographic examination performed during menopausal hormonal replacement therapy. It suggests good prognosis after surgery alone.",

The adequacy of the initial surgical procedure and histological grade of malignancy both influenced survival rates. In addition local recurrence was noted only in patients who had undergone \\\"inadequate\\\" initial excision. Inguinal lymph nodes were uninvolved by tumor in all cases. In general, patients with liposarcomas of myxoid and\\/or round cell type survived for long periods of time. However, even patients with myxoid lesions occasionally exhibited evidence of early blood-borne metastases. This study suggests an important relationship between an inadequate primary resection, local recurrence, and eventual retroperitoneal spread. In the majority of cases, this may have resulted from failure to control the primary distal extremity tumor, with subsequent contiguous spread of metastases into the ipsilateral retroperitoneal space. If feasible, radical soft part resection should be performed as the primary surgical therapy of these neoplasms. Tumors contiguous to the knee or ankle joint should be treated by primary amputation. Failure to control local disease may result in blood-borne dissemination or local spread along musculoaponeurotic planes to involve proximal groin or retroperitoneal space.",

The cells were elongated fibrous and spindle in shape, and neoplastic and pleomorphic features. The multinucleated giant cells with fine cytoplasm were seen. The cells proliferated slowly and the population doubling time was about 90 hours. The chromosome number showed a wide distribution of aneuploidy, the mode was hyperdiploid range (51-52), and many marker chromosomes were observed. The cells were transplantable into the submucosa of immunesuppressed hamster's cheek pouch and produced liposarcoma, while were not transplantable into subcutis of nude mice",

We have accumulated six round cell, four combined myxoid and round cell, and three myxoid liposarcomas for analysis. t(12;16)(q13;p11) was present in three round cell lesions and was detectable in all of the tumors by DNA analysis. In each tumor type, the CHOP gene in 12q13 was rearranged and fused to the TLS gene in 16p11. A variant TLS-CHOP RNA transcript was detected by polymerase chain reaction but did not correlate with clinicopathological data. No distinguishing cytogenetic or molecular markers for round cell or mixed lesions were found. The histogenic and genetic relatedness of myxoid and round cell liposarcomas is apparent from these data.",

They are most often localized in the lower extremity, followed by sarcomas in the retroperitoneal space which differ from the former in clinical appearance, epidemiology, and prognosis. The prognosis is especially dependent on tumor histology which is mainly classified into four subtypes. The aim of the study was to investigate whether there are specific CT-features for each histologic subgroup, by analyzing the examination of 20 patients. The highest percentage in fat and the biggest tumors were seen with well-differentiated liposarcomas (n = 4), whereas myxoid ones (n = 6) showed the sharpest margins. Round-cell (n = 2) and pleomorphic (n = 5) and pleomorphic (n = 5) types showed mainly soft-tissue attenuation and could not be differentiated, either from each other or from other soft-tissue tumors. A clear identification of the histologic subgroup does not seem to be possible.",

Clinical implementation of first-generation, nonselective CDK inhibitors, designed to inhibit this proliferation, was originally hampered by the high risk of toxicity and lack of efficacy noted with these agents. The emergence of a new generation of selective CDK4\\/6 inhibitors, including ribociclib, abemaciclib and palbociclib, has enabled tumour types in which CDK4\\/6 has a pivotal role in the G1-to-S-phase cell-cycle transition to be targeted with improved effectiveness, and fewer adverse effects. Results of pivotal phase III trials investigating palbociclib in patients with advanced-stage oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer have demonstrated a substantial improvement in progression-free survival, with a well-tolerated toxicity profile. Mechanisms of acquired resistance to CDK4\\/6 inhibitors are beginning to emerge that, although unwelcome, might enable rational post-CDK4\\/6 inhibitor therapeutic strategies to be identified. Extending the use of CDK4\\/6 inhibitors beyond ER-positive breast cancer is challenging, and will likely require biomarkers that are predictive of a response, and the use of combination therapies in order to optimize CDK4\\/6 targeting.",

The cyclin D-dependent kinase Cdk4 promotes progression through the G(1) phase of the cell cycle and is deregulated in many human tumors. The tumor suppressor protein p16(INK4A) (p16) forms a complex with Cdk4 and inhibits kinase activity. Here we report that p16 is phosphorylated, and the phosphorylated form of p16 is preferentially associated with Cdk4 in normal human fibroblasts. We mapped phosphorylation sites on exogenously overexpressed p16 to serines 7, 8, 140, and 152 and found that endogenous p16 associated with Cdk4 is phosphorylated at serine 152. All mapped phosphorylation sites lie outside of the conserved kinase-binding domain of p16 but in regions of the protein affected by mutations in familial and sporadic cancer. Our results suggest a novel regulation of p16 activity.",

Unlike other subtypes of osteosarcoma, no data have been published about mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) expression. For this reason, we evaluated the molecular and immunohistochemical features of MDM2 and CDK4 in 27 cases relative to 20 patients with a diagnosis of periosteal osteosarcoma, surgically treated at the Rizzoli Institute between 1981 and 2014. When possible, these results were compared with the MDM2 amplification status as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). All but 1 case (26\\/27, 96.3%) were negative for MDM2 protein using immunohistochemistry both in primary and in recurrent periosteal osteosarcoma, whereas gene amplification of MDM2 was not detected in any tumor analyzed (10 cases). The positive immunohistochemical case shows a weak\\/moderate focal nuclear expression of MDM2 antibody in the prevalent cartilaginous component and in the spindle cells of peripheral fibroblastic areas associated with osteoid production in a primary periosteal osteosarcoma. CDK4 immunohistochemical expression was negative in all 27 cases. This retrospective analysis has demonstrated that MDM2 and CDK4 are very rarely expressed in primary and recurrent periosteal osteosarcomas and therefore do not appear to be molecules central to the control of cancer development, growth, and progression in periosteal osteosarcoma. Therefore, when compared with low-grade central and parosteal osteosarcomas, MDM2 and CDK4 markers cannot be used diagnostically to differentiate this subtype of osteosarcoma.",

Therefore, CDK4 is an attractive target for the development of a novel anticancer agent. However, it is difficult to make CDK4-specific inhibitors that do not possess activity for other kinases, especially CDK2, because the CDK family has high structural homology. The three-dimensional structure of CDK2, particularly that bound with the inhibitor, has provided useful information for the synthesis of CDK2-specific inhibitors. The same approach used to make CDK4-specific inhibitors was hindered by the failure to obtain a crystal structure of CDK4. To overcome this problem, we synthesized a CDK4 mimic CDK2 protein in which the ATP binding pocket of CDK2 was replaced with that of CDK4. This CDK4 mimic CDK2 was crystallized both in the free and inhibitor-bound form. The structural information thus obtained was found to be useful for synthesis of a CDK4-specific inhibitor that does not have substantial CDK2 activity. Namely, the data suggest that CDK4 has additional space that will accommodate a large substituent such as the CDK4 selective inhibitor. Inhibitors designed to bind into this large cavity should be selective for CDK4 without having substantial CDK2 activity. This design principle was confirmed in the x-ray crystal structure of the CDK4 mimic CDK2 with a new CDK4 selective inhibitor bound.",

However, the response of these subgroups to chemotherapy is not well documented. In this study, we have conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of soft tissue sarcoma patients treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital. Eighty-eight liposarcoma patients who received chemotherapy between August 1989 and June 2004 were identified. The response rates to chemotherapy of the different histological subtypes and overall and progression free survival were investigated. Survival according to histological grade was also assessed. A statistically significant higher response rate to first-line chemotherapy was observed in patients with myxoid liposarcoma compared to de- and well-differentiated tumours, 48% (95%CI; 28-69) and 11% (95%CI; 2-29), P = 0.005. Similarly, those with myxoid liposarcoma had a significantly higher response rate compared to all other liposarcoma patients, 48% (95%CI; 28-69) and 18% (95%CI; 8-31). Patients with lower grade tumours had better overall survival. This retrospective analysis suggests that myxoid liposarcoma is relatively chemosensitive in comparison to a combination of other liposarcomas, and in particular de- and well-differentiated tumours. Further confirmation of these results should be sought by similar analyses of other databases.",

Here, we have employed SKY and high-resolution 244K oligonucleotide array CGH to characterize rearrangements and amplifications in a new WDLS cell line (GOT3) with a giant marker chromosome derived from chromosomes 12, 1, and X. The most prominent amplifications included 144 genes in 12q11-q21.2, 201 genes in 1q23.3-q44, and six genes in 13q32.1-q32.2. In the 12q amplicons, MDM2 showed the highest level of amplification followed by LYZ, HMGA2 (5'-part), TSPAN8, CNOT2, YEATS4, CDK4, GNS, HELB, and TSFM. Expression analysis of genes from the three major amplicons revealed that several highly amplified potential target genes, including HMGA2, MDM2, YEATS4, CDK4, PKP1, IPO9, and SOX21, were strongly overexpressed. Studies of cell cycle controlling proteins that interact with CDK4 and MDM2 revealed an abnormally strong expression of cyclins D1 and E. The selective high-level amplification of the 5'-part of HMGA2, including the DNA-binding domains, suggests that this gene is a major target of amplifications in WDLS. Our results also identify several novel candidate genes of potential pathogenetic and therapeutic importance for WDLS.",

Ultrasonography, aortography and computed tomographic (CT) scanning revealed the right kidney displaced by a huge and avascular mass containing fatty tissue. Also magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that it was contained of lipomatous tissue and demonstrated the mass occupying the entire right abdominal cavity. The tumor including the right kidney was resected, following diagnosis of the retroperitoneal tumor. The exercised tumor measured 28 X 22 X 18 cm and weighed 2,010g. The histological diagnosis was well-differentiated liposarcoma. She has been healthy for three months following postoperative chemotherapy. Many reports have been made on the ultrasonographic and CT appearance of retroperitoneal liposarcoma, but few have been made on the MRI appearance. According to our case, imaging diagnosis by MRI also seems to be useful in making a histological diagnosis of liposarcoma.",

A 52-year-old female patient with a history of breast carcinoma (70% invasive lobular carcinoma and 30% invasive ductal carcinoma) presented with a mass in the right lumbar region. The excised mass was diagnosed as myxoid liposarcoma. The tumor recurred twice and was reexcised. Microscopic examination of the second recurrence revealed multiple foci of breast carcinoma metastases in myxoid liposarcoma. Immunohistochemical study showed staining for CK19, GCDFP-15, estrogen and progesterone in metastases. Both breast carcinoma metastasis and myxoid liposarcoma were immunoreactive for E-cadherin and beta-catenin. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of breast carcinoma metastasis in myxoid liposarcoma, and the first occurrence of metastasis in a liposarcoma.",

The case of a patient with an extraordinary huge, resectable, well-differentiated retroperitoneal liposarcoma is reported. The presenting symptoms were abdominal pain and distension as well as weight gain. Magneticresonance imaging revealed a huge retroperitoneal tumor suspected of well-differentiated liposarcoma. Curative resection of the tumor could be obtained. Only 50% of all tumors are excised without residual tumor and recurrence, occurring in 90% after 10 years, is the main therapeutic challenge. Since neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy as well as intraoperative radiotherapy failed to prove prognostic value, curative resection remains the main treatment for primary and recurrent liposarcomas.",

Currently, the mainstay of therapy for liposarcoma is surgical excision because liposarcomas are often resistant to traditional chemotherapy. In light of the high mortality associated with liposarcoma and the lack of effective systemic therapy, we sought novel genomic alterations driving liposarcomagenesis that might serve as therapeutic targets. ZIC1, a critical transcription factor for neuronal development, is overexpressed in all five subtypes of liposarcoma compared with normal fat, and in liposarcoma cell lines compared with adipose-derived stem cells. Here, we show that ZIC1 contributes to the pathogenesis of liposarcoma. ZIC1 knockdown inhibits proliferation, reduces invasion, and induces apoptosis in dedifferentiated and myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma cell lines, but not in either adipose-derived stem cells or in a lung cancer cell line with low ZIC1 expression. ZIC1 knockdown is associated with increased nuclear expression of p27 proteins and the downregulation of prosurvival target genes BCL2L13, JunD, Fam57A, and EIF3M. Our results show that ZIC1 expression is essential for liposarcomagenesis and that targeting ZIC1 or its downstream targets might lead to novel therapy for liposarcoma.",

It was heterogeneous with marked posterior acoustic shadowing and small peripheral cysts on ultrasound. On MRI, it had ill-defined margins and was heterogeneous in signal intensity. Small round components which were hypointense on all sequences were demonstrated. There is significant overlapping of imaging features between paraffinoma and soft tissue liposarcoma.

The maturation of fat occurred from the peripherally located myxoid tissue to centrally located more mature fat cells. In our case, the capsular and interlobular mesenchymal tissue appeared to be intimately related to the formation of new immature fat lobules. In contrast, the myxoid liposarcoma showed a predominently myxoid appearance with many atypical bizarre lipoblasts; their nuclear atypia and pleomorphism were also evident in the cytologic examination of smears obtained from the gelatinous tumor. Furthermore, more mature fat cells, appearing as small foci, tended to be located at the periphery of the myxoid lobules that were incompletely separated by thin fibrous connective tissue septa.",

Most of them have a low level of malignancy and relapses tend to be localized. Metastasis, when present, occur through the haematological route, lymph spread being very unusual. Pre-operative diagnosis is infrequent and overall prognosis is good. The choice treatment is radical orchidectomy, while long-term follow-up of these patients is mandatory. When local relapses become evident, the choice treatment is extensive local excision, followed by optional adjuvant radiotherapy. Chemotherapy has not proven to be effective. This paper reviews the current literature and contributes one case of mixed liposarcoma of the spermatic cord.",

Recent years have seen the development of selective CDK4\\/6 inhibitors, which have delivered promising preclinical and clinical results in breast cancer and other tumours. A number of trials assessing antitumour efficacy in various disease settings and combinations are ongoing. The cyclin D1-CDK-Rb axis and its role in the cell cycle of normal and cancer cells are delineated. The early pan-CDK inhibitor flavopiridol and subsequent preclinical and clinical development of selective CDK4\\/6 inhibitors are described. Ongoing studies in breast cancer with novel CDK4\\/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib) are explored. A literature search of these topics was performed through PubMed. Abstracts from major oncology meetings were also reviewed. Selective CDK4\\/6 inhibitors, as represented by the competing compounds currently in clinical development, comprise a novel, safe and, thus far, promisingly efficacious group of drugs. Considerable resources are being devoted towards exploring the efficacy of these drugs in combination with endocrine therapies, an approach that has yielded encouraging results and accelerated approval by the US Food and Drugs Administration for one of these agents (palbociclib). The results of confirmatory phase 3 trials are, however, awaited. We discuss further therapy combinations in development and highlight potential areas for caution including the potential for antagonistic interactions with cytotoxic chemotherapies.",

Recent data demonstrate that Hif prolyl hydroxylase (Hph) is required for the induction of growth, but not for the induction of proliferation. Normal levels of Hph are required for cellular growth, demonstrating that Hph, in addition to its known function in the cellular response low oxygen levels, regulates growth. Since Hph's hydroxylation activity depends on oxygen and possibly the mitochondrial activity, these data provide a link between CycD\\/Cdk4 and oxygen\\/energy homeostasis.",

Anatomical and functional results, after demolishing surgical therapy, are sometimes unacceptable if the real benefits in terms of survival are considered. No supporting therapy has been used because of the presumed insensibility of the neoplasm to the chemo-radiotherapeutic treatments. At 2 years from surgical treatment no local relapses, on distance metastasis have been related.",

They are basically found at the retroperitoneum where they are relatively frequent in adults. The most common type is myxoid LS which, although less malignant, has like any other LS a high incidence of local relapses. Primary myxoid liposarcoma of the spermatic cord is an unusual, low-aggressiveness tumour. Under natural development, it can reach large dimensions with only local symptomatology. Pre-operative diagnosis of the paratesticular tumour is often difficult to establish, cuenca the teste su\\u00E9nate be differentiated from the tumoral mass by physical examination. A diagnostic approach of paratesticular tumours, scarcely reported in the literature, can be made by means of a vascular study with radionuclides. The choice therapy is surgical, through orchiectomy and extensive local removal. Considering the frequency of local relapse of myxoid liposarcoma, long-term follow-up is recommended. This paper reports the unusual presentation of one case of primary myxoid LS of the spermatic cord with an intrascrotal mass of 38 x 24 cm weighing 4,950 gr which is exceptional not only because of the site's infrequency but also for its size.",

Primary liposarcoma of the hypopharynx (piriform sinus) is extremely rare. The symptoms presented are principally dysphagia, dyspnea, dysphonia, airway obstruction and sensation of a foreign body. Treatment of choice is surgery, and the literature describes the performance of lateral pharyngotomy, simple excision and even total laryngectomy. We present the case of a 23-year-old patient who was diagnosed 7 years prior with liposarcoma of the piriform sinus. The patient underwent surgery using a cervical approach. The tumor recurred 4 years postoperatively and the patient was again surgically intervened using the same approach. He presented to our Institute with 3 months evolution of dysphonia. Nasofibrolaryngoscopy and imaging studies were performed. Surgical treatment was decided upon with CO2 laser using suspension microlaryngoscopy, obtaining excellent results. Some of the advantages of this approach are low morbidity because of the avoidance of performing a tracheostomy, rapid return to oral feeding without necessity of a feeding tube, and reduction in hospitalization days. Disadvantage includes difficulty in evaluating margins.",

A patient with known metastatic pleomorphic liposarcoma with a palpable thyroid nodule of 2 months' duration had a thyroid scan with 130 MBq (3.5 mCi) Tc-99m pertechnetate. The scan showed a cold nodule occupying most of the right lobe of the thyroid. Cytologic analysis of a fine-needle aspirate from this cold nodule confirmed metastasis from the known primary cancer, pleomorphic liposarcoma. In a patient with a known primary tumor, a nodule in the thyroid gland should be considered a metastatic lesion, regardless of the time since the primary tumor was diagnosed and treated, until proved otherwise.",

In most cases, the skin changes precede the clinical manifestation of the underlying neoplasm. The dermatosis can be cured only by removal of the underlying carcinoma. We describe a case of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica associated with a retroperitoneal liposarcoma in a 71-year-old Caucasian man. The liposarcoma was surgically removed but recurred several times, with acrokeratosis paraneoplastica showing a parallel development. We, therefore, add liposarcoma to the growing list of malignant neoplasms associated with acrokeratosis paraneoplastica.",

In the absence of a lipogenic component histologically, the differential diagnosis of a retroperitoneal DDL includes other sarcomas and, if the tumor has visceral involvement, sarcomatoid carcinoma. DDL demonstrates amplification of chromosome subregion 12q13-q15. Detection of the amplification itself, or the resulting overexpression of the MDM2 and CDK4 genes by genetic and immunohistochemical methods, is a useful ancillary test in the diagnosis of DDL. More recently, immunohistochemistry for p16, the product of the CDKN2A gene, was shown to be a useful adjunct in differentiating well-differentiated liposarcoma from benign adipocytic tumors. In the present study, we examined the utility of p16 immunohistochemistry to distinguish DDL (n=44) from other high-grade and low-grade retroperitoneal mimics (n=73). p16 positivity was observed in 43\\/44 (98%) DDLs, with the majority of these showing strong, diffuse, staining. The rate of p16 positivity in other retroperitoneal tumors was lower (37\\/73, 51%) and staining was not as consistently diffuse or intense. Furthermore, p16 positivity varied between the control sarcomas based on tumor type as follows: 11\\/11 leiomyosarcomas, 8\\/11 pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomas, 9\\/39 sarcomatoid carcinomas, 7\\/7 desmoid tumors, 1\\/3 endometrial stromal sarcomas, and 1\\/2 malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that p16 is highly sensitive for retroperitoneal DDL. However, the lack of specificity limits the diagnostic utility compared with the more established markers MDM2 and CDK4.",

Genetic and immunostaining analysis techniques may also prove to have valuable prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic implications for this disease.

The use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in treating this cancer remains experimental, but might be considered on a case-to-case basis for palliation or to treat aggressive variants of the disease.",

The tumor was 30 cm in size and weighed 6,500 g. The histological diagnosis was a well-differentiated liposarcoma. The second patient was a 72-year-old woman who visited our hospital after she had been diagnosed with an abdominal tumor by her family doctor. CT and MRI revealed a massive tumor involving various components. The tumor had invaded the left ureter and descending colon; therefore, we performed tumorectomy, left nephrectomy, and descending colectomy. The histopathological findings indicated a well-differentiated, myxoid, pleomorphic liposarcoma. The tumor recurred 4, 5, and 7 years after the first operation. By the fourth operation, the histological subtype of the tumor had changed to a dedifferentiated type.",

Recruitment of protein kinase clients to the Hsp90 chaperone system is mediated by the cochaperone adaptor protein Cdc37, which acts as a scaffold, simultaneously binding protein kinases and Hsp90. We have now expressed and purified an Hsp90-Cdc37-Cdk4 complex, defined its stoichiometry, and determined its 3D structure by single-particle electron microscopy. Comparison with the crystal structure of Hsp90 allows us to identify the locations of Cdc37 and Cdk4 in the complex and suggests a mechanism by which conformational changes in the kinase are coupled to the Hsp90 ATPase cycle.",

Three of the 28 myxoid tumors showed a pleomorphic pattern resembling that of the myxoid variant of malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and one of the 3 round-cell tumors was considered to be a malignant counterpart of hibernoma. Ages ranged from 22 to 86 years with the average age of 49 years, the average patients with myxoid or round-cell liposarcoma being over 10 years younger than those with well-differentiated or pleomorphic liposarcoma. There was also a variation in the site of predilection of the cases: the great majority of myxoid type tumors occurred in the thigh, popliteal fossa and buttock (23 cases), while the majority of well-differentiated type tumors were seen in the retroperitoneum (10 cases). The rate of local recurrence of the tumor was 46%. Four of the 5 well-differentiated liposarcomas which recurred exhibited dedifferentiated pleomorphic components resembling those in malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The prognosis was more favorable in patients with ordinary myxoid tumors than in those with well-differentiated tumors. The overall relative five-year survival rate was 63%.",

Mutations of the p53 gene have been found in different types of soft tissue sarcoma. It is generally accepted that p53 mutations in human malignant tumors are often related to a poor prognosis. In our case, analysis of p53 gene mutation in tumor samples was performed. p53 gene mutation was observed in dedifferentiated tumor tissue samples but not in well-differentiated tumor tissue samples. It has been reported that p53 gene mutation occurs most commonly in the retroperitoneum and rarely in other anatomic locations. Herein we report a case of dedifferentiated liposarcoma located at intraperitoneum.",

The most common entities, well differentiated\\/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WDLS\\/DDLS) and myxoid\\/round cell liposarcoma (MLS\\/RCLS), are both characterized by genetic rearrangements that affect the expression of the transcription factor DDIT3. DDIT3 induces liposarcoma morphology when ectopically expressed in a human fibrosarcoma. The role of DDIT3 in lipomatous tumors is, however, unclear. We have analyzed the expression of DDIT3 in 37 cases of liposarcoma (WDLS\\/DDLS n = 10, MLS\\/RCLS n = 16, and pleomorphic liposarcomas (PLS) n = 11) and 11 cases of common benign lipomas. Major cell subpopulations of WDLS\\/DDLS and MLS\\/RCLS tumors were found to express DDIT3 or the derived fusion protein, whereas PLS cases showed only a few positive cells. The lipomas contained large subpopulations expressing DDIT3. No correlation between numbers of DDIT3 expressing cells and numbers of lipoblasts\\/adipocytes was found. In vitro adipogenic treatment of two DDIT3 expressing cell lines induced lipid accumulation in small subpopulations only. Our results suggest a dual, promoting and limiting, role for DDIT3 in the formation of lipoblasts and liposarcoma morphology.",

To evaluate the diagnostic utility of this gene abnormality, we analyzed 19 liposarcomas, 21 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 3 leiomyosarcomas, 5 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 23 lipomas, and 28 nonneoplastic fat tissues using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In real-time PCR, all ALT\\/WDLs and DDLs had both MDM2 and CDK4 amplifications. The amplification levels in ALT\\/WDLs and DDLs were significantly higher than those in the other sarcomas, lipomas, and nonneoplastic fat tissues (P < .05); however, those in the other sarcomas and lipomas were not significantly higher than those in nonneoplastic tissues.

Mixed type liposarcomas were rare, and composed 13.8% of all retroperitoneal liposarcomas in this series. We described here a case of retroperitoneal mixed type liposarcoma. A 50-year-old man was admitted to our department with a mass in the left abdomen. Computed tomography and aortography revealed a huge and hypovascular tumor in the retroperitoneal cavity, not containing fat tissue. It was diagnosed as a retroperitoneal tumor and treated surgically. The tumor and the left kidney were encapsulated and could be removed en bloc. The size and weight of the tumor were 28 x 18 x 12 cm and 3,100 g, respectively. Histological examination of the mass proved it to be a mixed type liposarcoma. He was administered OK-432 as adjuvant therapy. After 11 months, bone metastasis to the vertebra appeared. Moreover, lung metastasis also occurred and he died of the disease 15 months after the operation.",

Patients are generally treated by chemotherapy and\\/or radiotherapy in combination with surgery, and would benefit from new personalized approaches. In this study we demonstrate the potential of combining personal genomic characterization of patient tumors to identify targetable mutations with in vitro testing of specific drugs in patient-derived cell lines. We have analyzed three metastases from a patient with high-grade metastatic dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) by exome and transcriptome sequencing as well as DNA copy number analysis. Genomic aberrations of several potentially targetable genes, including amplification of KITLG and FRS2, in addition to amplification of CDK4 and MDM2, characteristic of this disease, were identified. We evaluated the efficacy of drugs targeting these aberrations or the corresponding signaling pathways in a cell line derived from the patient. Interestingly, the pan-FGFR inhibitor NVP-BGJ398, which targets FGFR upstream of FRS2, strongly inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and induced an accumulation of cells into the G0 phase of the cell cycle. This study indicates that FGFR inhibitors have therapeutic potential in the treatment of DDLPS with amplified FRS2.",

The region of the chromosomal arm 12q that is amplified in malignant gliomas contains the CDK4 gene, a cell cycle regulatory gene which promotes cell division. To evaluate the frequency of CDK4 gene amplification, we analyzed a series of 355 brain tumors using a quantitative non-radioactive polymerase chain reaction assay. CDK4 gene amplification occurred in 9 of 81 glioblastomas (11%), but was rare in other neoplasms, including low-grade and anaplastic gliomas, meningiomas, medulloblastomas and metastatic carcinomas (only 6 of 274 cases). There was no correlation between CDK4 gene amplification and allelic loss of chromosome 12. To assess the significance of CDK4 gene amplification, we analyzed protein extracts from 37 glioblastomas by Western blotting with a commercially available polyclonal antibody to cdk4. All tumors with CDK4 gene amplification showed high cdk4 expression levels, whereas no increased cdk4 expression was seen in glioblastomas without CDK4 gene amplification. These data support the functional activity of CDK4 gene amplification in glioblastoma multiforme and point to an important role of CDK4 gene amplification in a subset of glioblastomas.",

Because of their rarity and anatomic location, these malignant tumors can cause a diagnostic dilemma and present several therapeutic challenges. They are usually associated with a high rate of recurrence despite grossly complete resection, thus requiring long-term and often indefinite follow-up. Relevant data on this topic was procured and synthesized with the aid of a comprehensive Medline search in addition to oncologic, pathologic, urologic, radiologic, and surgical literature review on retroperitoneal sarcomas. This article provides an in-depth review into the natural history, pathology, clinical manifestations, and prognostic features of retroperitoneal liposarcomas. It also discusses the reliability of diagnostic procedures and novel curative approaches that are currently being evaluated for the disease.",

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an inguinal mass, which mainly consisted of fat signal area and partially well enhanced in vascular density. Pre-surgical diagnosis was liposarcoma of spermatic cord estimated by radiographic examination and resection of the right intrascrotal tumor with high inguinal orchitectomy was performed. Histopathological diagnosis revealed well-differentiated liposarcoma. No recurrence phenomenon has been observed after 12 months without any adjuvant therapy. This case is the 129th report of intrascrotal liposarcoma in the Japanese literature.",

Embryonic fibroblasts proliferate normally in the absence of Cdk4 but have a delayed S phase on re-entry into the cell cycle. Moreover, mice devoid of Cdk4 are viable, but small in size and infertile. These mice also develop insulin-deficient diabetes due to a reduction in beta-islet pancreatic cells. In contrast, mice expressing a mutant Cdk4 that cannot bind the cell-cycle inhibitor P16INK4a display pancreatic hyperplasia due to abnormal proliferation of beta-islet cells. These results establish Cdk4 as an essential regulator of specific cell types.",

Its rarity makes a systematic and in-depth understanding of these uncommon entities extremely difficult. Here we aimed to characterize and analyze the epidemiology, clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment and prognosis of primary oral and maxillofacial liposarcomas by presenting our experience from a Chinese tertiary referral hospital and literature review. All relevant information was manually collected from medical records from the authors' department (1993-2009) and literature retrieval (Jan.1940-Sep.2009). A total number of 150 patients were identified and included with mean age 49.1 years old and a slight male preponderance. These lesions mostly occurred in tongue (32.0%) followed by buccal region (28.7%) and were diagnosed as atypical lipmatous tumor\\/well-differentiated (58.45%) and myxoid liposarcomas (27.5%) by pathologic re-evaluation and re-categorization based on 2002 WHO classification scheme. Complete surgical excision with negative margins was the primary treatment modality, while therapeutic utilities of adjuvant radiotherapy\\/chemotherapy remained controversial. Our data reinforced histopathologic subtype as one of key prognostic factors irrespective of gender, age and primary sites for this malignancy. More importantly, our analysis further revealed that tumor size (especially when larger than 3.6 cm) served as another important prognostic factor suggesting higher rates of disease-related death. Taken together, these findings might for the first time provide comprehensive information regarding the epidemiology, clinicopathologic features, treatment and prognosis of oral and maxillofacial liposarcoma.",

We have analyzed here the role of calmodulin in the activity, the expression, and the intracellular location of proteins involved in G1 progression. The addition of anti-calmodulin drugs to normal rat kidney cells in early G1 inhibited cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) and Cdk2 activities, as well as retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. Protein levels of cdk4, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin E, p21, and p27 were not affected after CaM inhibition, whereas decreases in the amount of cyclin A and Cdc2 were observed. The decrease of Cdk4 activity was due neither to changes in its association to cyclin D1 nor to changes in the amount of p21 or p27 bound to cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes. Calmodulin inhibition also produced a translocation of nuclear cyclin D1 and Cdk4 to the cytoplasm. This translocation could be responsible for the decreased Cdk4 activity upon calmodulin inhibition. Immunoprecipitation, calmodulin affinity chromatography, and direct binding experiments indicated that calmodulin associates with Cdk4 and cyclin D1 through a calmodulin-binding protein. The facts that Hsp90 interacts with Cdk4 and that its inhibition induced Cdk4 and cyclin D1 translocation to the cytoplasm point to Hsp90 as a good candidate for being the calmodulin-binding protein involved in the nuclear accumulation of Cdk4 and cyclin D1.",

Immunohistochemistry for mdm2 and cdk4 was performed on 20 cases. Comparative genomic hybridization was performed on 18 samples from 13 patients. Seventeen cases were reclassified as dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Twenty-one of 32 samples from these patients showed areas of well-differentiated liposarcoma, allowing the diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Immunohistochemistry performed in 15 of these cases showed positivity for mdm2 and cdk4. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis performed on 15 samples from 11 of these patients showed an amplification of the 12q13-15 region. Eight cases were reclassified as poorly differentiated sarcoma. Twelve samples from these patients showed no area of well-differentiated liposarcoma. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for mdm2 and cdk4 in one of six of these patients and showed positivity for CD34 in another one. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis performed on three samples from two of these patients showed no amplification of the 12q13-15 region but showed complex profiles. This study shows that most so-called malignant fibrous histiocytomas developed in the retroperitoneum are dedifferentiated liposarcoma and that a poorly differentiated sarcoma in this area should prompt extensive sampling to demonstrate a well-differentiated liposarcoma component, immunohistochemistry for mdm2 and cdk4, and if possible, a cytogenetic or a molecular biology analysis.",

A variety of clinical, gross, and microscopic features are useful in predicting behavior. Unfortunately, a number of different classification systems for liposarcoma with confusing nomenclature appear in the literature. This paper reviews general features affecting prognosis and presents a summary of the major classification systems. A subclassification of tumors into three grades (high, intermediate, and low) is suggested, based on potential for malignant behavior. Our system of grading may be used to guide the surgeon in the course of therapy. In light of the potential for confusion in identification and classification, good communication between surgeon and pathologist is essential to choice of appropriate therapy and ensuing chances for recurrence or survival.",

Primary liposarcomas of the kidney are very rare. Here, we present the cases of two patients diagnosed with retroperitoneal perirenal myxoid liposarcoma. The patients were diagnosed via imaging, which in both cases revealed a huge right retroperitoneal tumour mass compressing the abdominal organs and large blood vessels. Surgical intervention consisting of en bloc resection of the tumour and the right kidney was performed using a transperitoneal approach. Three years after the surgery, both patients presented local recurrence, for which they underwent chemotherapy. Liposarcomas with renal origin are rare clinical entities with a high rate of malignancy and a poor prognosis. Because the use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of such liposarcomas is controversial, the treatment of choice is wide surgical resection with clean margins.",

A left hemilaminectomy, extending from the thirteenth thoracic to the second lumbar vertebrae, was done, and an extradural mass was removed. The tumor was identified histologically as myxoid liposarcoma. The dog's neurologic function improved gradually after surgery; however, at 7 months after surgery, hind limb neurologic function deteriorated rapidly over a 5-week period, presumably because of local recurrence of the tumor. The dog was euthanatized; necropsy was not permitted.",

However, cytogenetic identification of ring and giant rod chromosomes supports the diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma\\/atypical lipomatous tumor. These abnormal chromosomes are mainly composed of amplified genomic sequences derived from chromosome 12q13-15, and contain several genes, including MDM2, CDK4 (SAS), TSPAN31, HMGA2, and others. MDM2 is consistently amplified in well-differentiated liposarcomas\\/atypical lipomatous tumors, and up to 25% in other sarcomas. As part of a large genomic study of lipomatous neoplasms, we initially found CPM to be consistently amplified in well-differentiated liposarcomas\\/atypical lipomatous tumors. To further explore this initial finding, we investigated the copy number status of MDM2 and CPM by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on a series of 138 tumors and 17 normal tissues, including 32 well-differentiated liposarcoma\\/atypical lipomatous tumors, 63 lipomas, 11 pleomorphic lipomas, 2 lipoblastomas, 30 other tumors and 17 normal fat samples. All 32 well-differentiated liposarcoma\\/atypical lipomatous tumors showed amplification of MDM2 and CPM, usually >20 copies per cell. The other tumors lacked MDM2 and\\/or CPM amplification. Chromogenic in situ hybridization confirmed the above results on a subset of these tumors (n=27). These findings suggest that identification of CPM amplification could be used as an alternative diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma\\/atypical lipomatous tumors.",

This particular cell type controls insulin secretion through a fine-tuned process, which dregulation have important pathological consequences, such as observed during type 2 diabetes. We recently implicated E2F1 in the control of glucose homeostasis. First we showed that E2f1-\\/- mice have decreased pancreatic size, as the result of impaired postnatal pancreatic growth. We observed in this study that E2F1 was highly expressed in non-proliferating pancreatic beta-cells, suggesting that E2F1, besides the control of beta-cell number could have a role in pancreatic beta-cell function. We demonstrate in our recent study, both in vitro and in vivo that E2F1 directly regulates the expression of Kir6.2, a key component of the KATP channel involved in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. Expression of Kir6.2 is lost in pancreas of E2f1-\\/- mice, resulting in insulin secretion defects in these mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated by in tissue chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis that regulation of Kir6.2 expression by E2F1 follows the same regulatory pathway that the classical E2F1 target genes, implicating the participation of CDK4 and retinoblastoma protein. Moreover, in this context, E2F1 transcriptional activity is regulated by glucose and insulin through the CDK4-dependent inactivation of the pRB protein. In summary we provide evidence that the CDK4-pRB-E2F1 regulatory pathway is involved in glucose homeostasis. In our recent study we decipher a new function for these factors in the control of insulin secretion and open up new avenues for the treatment of metabolic diseases, in particular type 2 diabetes.",

However, intermingled transition in a mosaic pattern between WDL and DDL is not infrequently encountered. Here, the authors review clinicopathological features of 30 cases of DDL associated with lipoma-like WDL. Histological examination revealed 20 tumors that showed an abrupt transition between WDL and DDL. Among these, 13 tumors showed high-grade spindle-cell sarcoma having histological features of unclassified malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH)-like sarcoma (high-grade DDL [HDDL]). The remaining 7 tumors showed moderate cellular spindle-cell proliferation with mild nuclear atypia and scant mitotic figures (low-grade DDL [LDDL]). The other 10 tumors showed intermingled transition between WDL and DDL. The interface between these 2 components overlapped, resulting in frequent occurrence of a lipogenic spindle-cell component (comingling DDL). Based on the cellularity and nuclear atypia of the spindle-cell components, there were 7 comingling HDDLs and 3 comingling LDDLs. The histology of comingling LDDL simulated an admixture of spindle-cell liposarcoma and LDDL, and distinction from each other was practically difficult. The histology of comingling HDDL simulated pleomorphic liposarcoma. Follow-up data, available for 23 patients (median, 39 months), showed that 2 patients died of tumor (both had HDDL), and 1 patient died of unrelated disease; 8 patients were alive with recurrent or metastatic diseases (3 HDDLs, 3 LDDLs, and 2 comingling HDDLs). Statistical analysis by Fisher's exact test showed no correlation between histological subtypes (HDDL and LDDL, and typical DDL and comingling DDL).",

The majority of cases of well-differentiated liposarcoma follow a relatively benign course, but the disease has a high recurrence rate. It appears that accurate clinical and histopathologic diagnosis of this lesion is difficult. The prognosis seems to depend on the histologic type, size, and location of the lesion.

However, diagnostic discordance remains even among expert sarcoma pathologists. We sought to develop a more systematic approach to liposarcoma classification based on gene expression analysis and to identify subtype-specific differentially expressed genes that may be involved in liposarcoma genesis\\/progression and serve as potential therapeutic targets. A classifier based on gene expression profiling was able to distinguish between liposarcoma subtypes, lipoma, and normal fat samples. A 142-gene predictor of tissue class was derived to automatically determine the class of an independent validation set of lipomatous samples and shows the feasibility of liposarcoma classification based entirely on gene expression monitoring. Differentially expressed genes for each liposarcoma subtype compared with normal fat were used to identify histology-specific candidate genes with an in-depth analysis of signaling pathways important to liposarcoma pathogenesis and progression in the well-differentiated\\/dedifferentiated subset. The activation of cell cycle and checkpoint pathways in well-differentiated\\/dedifferentiated liposarcoma provides several possible novel therapeutic strategies with MDM2 serving as a particularly promising target. We show that Nutlin-3a, an antagonist of MDM2, preferentially induces apoptosis and growth arrest in dedifferentiated liposarcoma cells compared with normal adipocytes. These results support the development of a clinical trial with MDM2 antagonists for liposarcoma subtypes which overexpress MDM2 and show the promise of using this expression dataset for new drug discovery in liposarcoma.",

So far, it has been considered to be a special subtype of MFH. As it is now widely accepted that most retroperitoneal pleomorphic MFHs are dedifferentiated liposarcomas, the present study compared histological features, genomic profile (CGH analysis), and MDM2 and CDK4 status (immunohistochemistry, FISH, and quantitative PCR) in inflammatory MFHs from 12 patients and dedifferentiated liposarcomas that had an inflammatory MFH component from eight patients. Metaphase cytogenetic and FISH analyses were also performed on one inflammatory MFH. Histological review showed areas of well-differentiated liposarcoma in nine inflammatory MFHs. CGH analysis showed 12q13-15 amplification or gain in six of seven inflammatory MFHs and in seven of seven dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity of tumour cells for MDM2 in every tumour in both groups and for CDK4 in ten and seven inflammatory MFHs and dedifferentiated liposarcomas, respectively. Metaphase cytogenetic and FISH analysis performed on one inflammatory MFH showed the presence of a supernumerary large marker chromosome and ring chromosome with high-level amplification of both MDM2 and CDK4 genes. FISH analysis on paraffin wax-embedded sections showed amplifications of MDM2 and CDK4 in seven of seven inflammatory MFHs and in seven of seven dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Quantitative PCR showed amplification of MDM2 in six and of CDK4 in seven of nine inflammatory MFHs. In conclusion, this study strongly suggests that most so-called inflammatory MFHs are dedifferentiated liposarcomas.",

The neck, shoulder region and back are the sites of predilection. The clinical setting is similar to that seen with spindle-cell lipoma. The lesion is characterized by an intricate mixture of mature fibrous tissue, adipose tissue and myxoid tissue interspersed with cellular foci. Most characteristic of the latter are a variety of giant cells and especially the 'floret' giant-cells, so named because of the arrangement of their nuclei which is reminiscent of the petals of a flower. The pleomorphism of the lesion frequently leads to misdiagnosis as liposarcoma. Criteria for the differentiation from the various types of liposarcoma are discussed. The possible relationship of pleomorphic lipoma to some of the 'atypical lipomas' described in the recent literature is analysed. The pleomorphic lipoma is a benign lesion of subcutaneous tissue which must be sharply differentiated from sarcomas. Some of the liposarcomas alleged in the literature to have originated within a pre-existing lipoma possibly represented pleomorphic lipomas. Pleomorphic lipoma is an entity which must be added to the growing number of pseudosarcomatous lesions of soft tissue.",

This chromosome rearrangement, thus far not described in liposarcomas, leads to recombination of bands 12q13 and 16p11.2 and, thus, seems to be the equivalent of t(12;16)(q13;p11), a translocation that is highly specific for the myxoid type of liposarcoma. Our case represents the fourth fully karyotyped round cell liposarcoma that displays a cytogenetic rearrangement of bands 12q13 and 16p11, thus supporting the concept that round cell liposarcoma is related to myxoid liposarcoma and constitutes its poorly differentiated form. The fact that ins(12;16) was the only detectable chromosome aberration suggests that the presence of secondary cytogenetic aberrations is not a prerequisite for the development of a round cell histology in liposarcoma.",

He had no findings on physical examination.Discussion. Chest X-ray revealed a large mass in the left anterior mediastinum. Computerized tomography of the chest showed a well-delineated homogeneous mediastinal mass with fat-equivalent density and a small pleural effusion. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed narrowing of the left main bronchus, secondary to external compression. The bronchial mucosa was normal and brush cytology was negative. A CT-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the mass yielded fragments of cells embedded in myxoid background material and closely packed atypical lipoblasts, compatible with liposarcoma. The patient underwent a left lateral thoracotomy and margibnal resection of the mass. The histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of mixed-type liposarcoma, consisted of myxoid and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Postoperative two-field radiation therapy was delivered to the mediastinum for a total midplane dose of 40 Gy. After a disease-free interval of 8 months the disease recurred in the mediastinum and pleura. Palliative chemotherapy achieved a short duration partial response but the patient succumbed to local recurrence 2 years after the diagnosis.",

                    "abstract": "Although most cases of atypical lipomatous tumor\\/well-differentiated liposarcoma (ALT\\/WDL) can be diagnosed solely on the basis of histologic features, those lacking diagnostic histologic features require ancillary studies for accurate classification. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for amplification of MDM2 has been considered the gold standard for diagnosis in these situations. Immunostaining for MDM2 and\\/or CDK4 has been adopted as a surrogate method because of its high concordance rate with FISH and lower cost. However, studies examining the concordance of the 2 methods have been based preferentially on cases in which the diagnosis could be established histologically. No study has explored the concordance between the 2 methods in histologically ambiguous cases or in cases in which the diagnosis of ALT\\/WDL is not apparent after a review of all slides. To address this, we performed immunostaining for MDM2 and CDK4 on 183 well-differentiated lipomatous tumors that could not be diagnosed on purely histologic grounds and that were, therefore, subjected to FISH analysis. These included ALT\\/WDLs (n=56), lipomas (n=96), and lipoma variants (n=31). Staining for MDM2 and CDK4 was noted in 25\\/56 and 23\\/56 ALT\\/WDL, respectively, giving a sensitivity of 45% and 41% and a specificity of 98% and 92%. Staining was noted exclusively in the nuclei of atypical cells and not in the nuclei of adipocytes. Staining for MDM2 and CDK4 occurred in 2\\/125 and 10\\/117 benign lipomatous lesions, respectively. False-positive staining was equivalent in intensity to ALT\\/WDL. We conclude that MDM2 and CDK4 staining is a relatively insensitive method for diagnosing ALT\\/WDL in cases that are histologically ambiguous, as staining is restricted to neoplastic cells with atypia that are underrepresented in these cases. Therefore, in cases like ours that closely simulate clinical practice, FISH is the more reliable and cost-effective option.",

A smaller part of the tumor was placed on the outside of the right atrial wall, and implants of the tumor in the distal part of the aorta, extending backward to the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery and its branches, were also observed.

These cases have been highly differentiated liposarcomas, just like our case. The unremarkable clinical picture of these tumors is that of a soft, lipomatous, smooth limited tumor. Findings first appear to be consistent with a lipoma and not a malignancy. Our case of a 23-year-old man is the youngest patient with a laryngeal liposarcoma described thus far. We discuss the surgical procedure used, especially in view of a local recurrence rate of approximately 60%, as well as additional radiotherapy. The treatment of choice is extensive local tumor resection. Chemotherapy is presently not useful for highly differentiated liposarcomas.",

A 62-year-old man presented because of air-way obstruction. A CT scan discovered a large 5 cm polypoid mass in the right aryepiglottic fold. The patient had already undergone three previous operations for the same reason in another clinic, with histopathological diagnoses of fibrovascular polyps. In the last recurrence, only a careful search for lipoblasts in the surgical specimen allowed us to identify this lesion as a low-grade well-differentiated liposarcoma.

The lesion, that was associated with a right vocal cord palsy, caused severe lateral displacement of the trachea and oesophagus. The case has been managed by complete surgical resection through a combined cervical and thoracic approach associated with a tracheostomy due to the risk of bilateral recurrent nerve dysfunction at the end of the intervention.

By light microscopy, there was a problem as to whether the tumour should be classified with the liposarcomas or with the fibrous histiocytic group. Ultrastructurally, spindle shaped cells resembled fibroblasts and, in a few cells, intracellular collagen fibres were seen. Histochemical studies revealed the presence of mannose-rich glycoprotein which is characteristic for collagen producing cells, but frequently these cells also showed numerous lipid inclusion. The foamy cytoplasmic areas of pleomorphic cells were shown to consist of dilated ergastoplasmic sacs and large vacuoles lined by smooth endoplasmic reticulum negating the possibility that these cells were of histiocytic origin. This is supported further by the dearth of lysosomes and absence of lysozyme (muramidase) in the tumour cells. The presence of numerous lipid inclusions in many of the tumour cells, which are otherwise ultrastructurally similar to fibroblast, suggests that these cells represent precursors of lipoblasts. The above findings taken together allowed the tumour to be categorized as a sclerosing liposarcoma.",

The tumor did not respond to chemotherapy, and the patient died of respiratory failure and sepsis. At autopsy, pleomorphic sarcoma was histologically dominant and contained a liposarcoma element confirmed by histocytological and electron microscopic analysis. Adenocarcinoma component with papillary and tubular patterns was confined to the medial lesion of the right lower lobe (3x8 cm), which was found in the chest X-ray 3 years before admission, and had continuously merged with the sarcomatous lesion through the histological transition of both components. Aggressive and rapid growth of the sarcoma derived from the earlier adenocarcinoma became prevalent and contributed to the severe clinical outcome.

We herein describe 9 cases of well-differentiated\\/dedifferentiated liposarcoma with distinct areas of fibroosseous tissue histologically indistinguishable from low-grade osteosarcomas, that is, parosteal osteosarcoma or low-grade central osteosarcoma. The tumors affected middle-aged to elderly patients, and occurred in the retroperitoneum and deep soft tissue of the extremities without connection to the skeletal system. Grossly, all the tumors showed biphasic appearance with lipogenic and osteogenic area, the latter representing 5% to 50% of the total tumor volume. Histologically, the lipogenic component exhibited typical histology of well-differentiated liposarcoma, whereas the osteogenic area consisted of fibroosseous tissue with numerous mature neoplastic bone trabeculae largely lacking osteoblastic rimming, with intervening fascicles of spindle cell proliferation showing low nuclear grade. All samples were positive for MDM2 and\\/or CDK4 on immunohistochemical analysis; the antibodies stained many osteocytes, indicating that the bone is neoplastic rather than reactive. Three cases showed high-grade osteosarcomatous transformation juxtaposed to the low-grade osteosarcomatous component, reminiscent of the \\\"dedifferentiation\\\" phenomenon of skeletal low-grade osteosarcoma. Follow-up revealed local recurrence in 4 cases, but no distant metastases were documented. Recognition of this earlier underappreciated subtype of well-differentiated\\/dedifferentiated liposarcoma is important, because the fibroosseous component may seem so bland that it may be confused with benign metaplasia such as myositis ossificans, or conversely, the lipomatous component may be inconspicuous that it may be dismissed as normal fat, and such misinterpretation may potentially result in suboptimal treatment.",

Since Oct. 1976 to Dec. 1995, 21 cases of liposarcoma were treated by operation. 15 cases were male and 6 cases female. The onset of the disease occurred between 6-79 years of age with an average of 49.9 years. 13 cases were well-differentiated, 4 Myxoid, 4 cases of andifferentiaed. All cases were followed up with an average of 8.9 years. The 5-, 10-year survival rate was 94%, the 5-, 10-year unrecurernce rate was 72% and 52%. Among the malignant soft tissue tumors liposarcoma, was most common. The survival rate was related to the pathological type, the site and the size. Good clinical results were well-differentiated and myxoid. The poor was retroperitoneal liposarcoma. The smaller the tumor, the better the result. For the treatment, wide margin excision is a good method of choice.",

By electron microscopy, cytoplasmic lipid is membrane-bound. Immunohistochemical staining for vimentin and histiocytic markers may be helpful. Liposarcoma is diagnosed only when there is convincing evidence of synthesis and storage of fat by the tumor cells. By electron microscopy, cytoplasmic lipid is nonmembrane-bound. Both MFH and liposarcoma have subtypes. In MFH, the pleomorphic forms are the most common. Myxoid MFH is less common; all other types are rare. In liposarcoma, the myxoid types are by far the most common. The myxoid types of both MFH and liposarcoma may contain other elements that vary in degree and geographic distribution and that can raise the histologic grade. About 50% of liposarcomas are low-grade tumors; these are almost always purely myxoid. Low-grade myxoid liposarcoma has a much better prognosis than other types. Myxoid liposarcoma has a better prognosis than myxoid MFH. The peak incidence of MFH is in the seventh decade of life whereas that of liposarcoma is in the fifth decade. A substantial number (roughly 25% to 30%) of MFHs occur in the subcutaneous tissue. Clinically they are almost invariably mistaken for ganglion cysts. Liposarcoma, however, is likely to occur in or below the buttocks. Most are in the anterior thigh. Subcutaneous liposarcoma is extremely rare. A tumor in this area is likely to be either a more malignant myxoid MFH or one of the benign atypical lipomatous tumors. In both MFH and liposarcoma, the development of distant lesions is related to the tumor's histologic grade and size and to local recurrence. Favored metastatic sites of MFH are lung and lymph nodes. Favored sites of distant lesions in the myxoid\\/round cell types of liposarcoma are intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, other soft-tissue areas (especially in the neck), and bone. Lymph node involvement is very rare. Because myxoid\\/round cell liposarcomas have a marked propensity to involve intra-abdominal sites, abdominal computed tomography and bone scan are recommended in the initial evaluation and follow-up of high-risk patients (those with high-grade tumors larger than 15 cm and those with local recurrence of intermediate- or high-grade tumors of any size).",

Radiography revealed a lytic lesion extending from L5 to L6 to the ilium. At necropsy, an 8 x 2 to 3.2 x 3 cm, irregular, white, firm mass was identified extending from the left dorsolateral aspect of the L6 vertebrae to the sacrum, crossing the sacroiliac joint to the ilium, and reaching the acetabulum without affecting the joint cartilage. Tumor masses were also present bilaterally near the costochondral junction of several ribs. White, soft nodules were present in the heart, pericardium, lungs, spleen, and kidneys as well. Histologically, osteolysis with disruption of the cortical bone and reactive bone with the presence of multinucleated osteoclasts was noted. Neoplastic cells consisted of variable, small basophilic round cells (SBRC) with very scant cytoplasm, larger polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, and vacuolated cells resembling adipocytes. Within the marrow cavity, vacuolated cells with necrosis predominated, whereas in periosteal areas, polygonal and vacuolated cells that were mixed with a lower percentage of SBRC were more common. In the lungs and heart, SBRC predominated, and in the spleen, polygonal cells were more numerous. Tumor cells stained positive for vimentin and S-100 and stained negative for CD99, neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, cytokeratins, desmin, myoglobin, and actin. This tumor most likely arose from the marrow cavity of the L6 and later invaded through the vertebral body into adjacent vertebrae and various visceral sites.",

Histologically, it contained a 1.5 cm inflammatory nodule, which was surrounded by otherwise typical lipoma-like liposarcoma. The inflammatory nodule was composed of lymphocytic aggregates and spindle to stellate cells with mild atypism. No lipoblasts were seen in this area which mimicked an inflammatory pseudotumor.

Despite CT, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and a surgical biopsy, a patient with mesenteric lipodystrophy was misdiagnosed as having a low-grade mesenteric liposarcoma. Spontaneous regression of the mass on control CT scan and review of the pathological material prompted us to reconsider the diagnosis of malignancy. Because a wide variety of tumors and pseudotumors produce alterations in the density and volume of mesenteric fat on CT scan, a surgical biopsy is usually necessary to obtain a tissue-specific diagnosis, but even then pathological findings may be equivocal. As final resort the natural evolution assessed by radiological follow-up can be of help in determining the nature of the disease.",

Incisional biopsy revealed mature adipose cells with a slight variation in size and shape; no lipoblasts were observed. Therefore, at this stage we made the diagnosis of lipoma. However, the histological study of the tumor specimen subsequently obtained by surgery, showed mature adipose cells, atypical cells with bizarre nuclei, and lipoblasts with scalloped-shaped nuclei. We eventually diagnosed the tumor as a well-differentiated liposarcoma, adipocytic type (lipoma-like type).

Soft-tissue radionuclide accumulation occurred in two lipomas and corresponded to radiographically evident calcification. All liposarcomas were uncalcified and demonstrated intense radionuclide activity. This activity may be related to the angiographic and histologic hypervascularity of liposarcomas, which is also demonstrable on computed tomography as contrast enhancement; hence, these modalities offer the same nonspecific diagnostic information. It is concluded, however, that plain radiography and radionuclide scaning should suffice to establish the diagnosis of lipoma.",

The huge tumor was resected successfully. However, the tumor recurred repeatedly and she had repeated hepatectomies to remove the tumor. The tumor became aggravating after repeated surgeries. Eventually, the patient had cervical spinal metastasis of liposarcoma and she survived for 26 months after liver liposarcoma was diagnosed. Although the tumor may become aggravating after repeated surgeries, repeated hepatectomies are still the best policy to achieve a long-term survival for the patients.",

Rhabdomyosarcomas in childhood and leiomyosarcomas in adults are the most frequent histological types. Liposarcomas, fibrosarcomas and osteosarcomas are less frequent. The spermatic cord liposarcoma originates from the spermatic cord fatty tissue and therefore it consist of adipose cells, fibroblasts and myxomatosus cells; such neoplasms are usually very well differentiated. Diagnosis is suggested by the appearance of a progressively enlarging mass and by echotomography which shows a solid or liquid mass of the spermatic cord. Therapy consists of surgical intervention (orchifunicolectomy) which also allows a correct histological diagnosis. The case of a 56 year-old male who underwent left orchifunicolectomy for a sarcoma of spermatic cord occasionally discovered during surgical repair of a left groin hernia is reported. Six months after the intervention the patient is in good condition and there is no evidence of relapse.",

The patients (two men and two women) were 47, 48, 68, and 72 years of age when first seen. The primary tumors were large retroperitoneal, well-differentiated liposarcomas, one featuring areas of dedifferentiation (without muscle elements). A myosarcomatous component became evident at the first recurrence in three cases and at the second recurrence in one. This component was always within dedifferentiated areas and in three of the cases coincided with the emergence of the latter. The muscle component had exclusively leiomyosarcomatous phenotype (alpha-smooth-muscle actin reactivity) in one case, exclusively rhabdomyosarcomatous phenotype (myoglobin reactivity) in two cases, and combined leiomyosarcomatous and rhabdomyosarcomatous phenotype (alpha-smooth-muscle actin and myoglobin) in one case. Ultrastructural studies of one of the tumors with a rhabdomyosarcomatous component revealed the presence of sarcomeres. Two patients died of extensive retroperitoneal disease, one patient died following the attempted removal of a recurrence, and one patient is alive and free of disease. These cases demonstrate that the dedifferentiated component of liposarcoma may exhibit a myosarcomatous component, a feature analogous to that previously described in dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma.",

Furthermore, this study emphasised the value of electron microscopy in the diagnosis of neoplasms which are complex from a morphological standpoint.",

Immunohistochemical studies were performed on frozen tissue in five cases and on paraffin-embedded tissue in three cases. Chromosomal analysis demonstrated a balanced translocation t(12;16) (q13;p11) as the sole abnormality in four cases. Two cases showed an association with other abnormalities. Three tumors showed variants of the t(12;16) translocation involving other chromosomes. In all cases studied, the 12q13 breakpoint was involved in rearrangements. In the majority of cases, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated vimentin (9 of 9) and S-100 protein (8 of 9). Strong focal expression of desmin was observed in two tumors. Weak focal expression was observed in three tumors. Two tumors, which were both desmin positive, showed focal expression of MSA and alpha-SMA. Strong expression of CD36 was present in all four cases that were studied for this marker. CD34 was negative in tumor cells, but it highlighted an intricate capillary network in the tumor. Close relationship between the tumor cells and pericapillary pericytes was demonstrated with CD34 and alpha-SMA strains. The authors conclude that myxoid liposarcoma is characterized by a specific chromosomal rearrangement. Its immunohistochemical profile is wider than previously believed, including expression of muscle markers.",

It produces nonspecific symptoms and is often extensive when diagnosed. In this report, we present a case of a 68-year-old female patient who had a 29-kg retroperitoneal liposarcoma. Her early symptoms--including vague digestive disturbances, increasing abdominal girth and an abdominal mass, and clinical examinations such as sonography and computed tomography scan led to a preoperative diagnosis of ovarian cancer, until surgical and pathologic confirmation. Gross, radical resection of the tumor was successfully performed, and provided the most effective primary therapeutic approach. Histopathology revealed a mixed-type liposarcoma, with metastasis to the appendix. A poor prognosis was expected. Postoperative periodic follow-up was started to monitor for early detection of recurrence.",

Features closely resembling those of developing fetal adipose tissue were seen in all tumors. THe various cell types identified ranged from undifferentiated cells to typical multivacuolated and univacuolated lipoblasts. In addition, a secretory type mesenchymal cell with distended cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum was found in every case as well as intermediate cells with secretory product and lipid accumulation. relative proportions of these types varied from case to case. A prominent feature in all cases was the particular spatial relationship of the abundant capillaries to the various cell types. The undifferentiated cells had perivascular processes with a tendency to envelop the primitive capillaries. These cells progressively enlarged and acquired features of the differentiated cell types as they separated from the lamina. Mitotic activity, when detectable, was prominent in the capillary wall and its vicinity. Lipoblasts resembling those of brown adipose tissue frequently coexisted in the same tumor with others analogous to those of white adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that tumor cells in liposarcoma originate from a dividing population of perivascular mesenchymal cells, in a manner akin to that of developing white adipose tissue.",

Here, we show that zebrafish expressing constitutively active Akt2 in mesenchymal progenitors develop WDLPS that closely resembles the human disease. Tumor incidence rates were 8% in p53 wild-type zebrafish, 6% in p53 heterozygotes, and 29% in p53-homozygous mutant zebrafish (P = 0.013), indicating that aberrant Akt activation collaborates with p53 mutation in WDLPS pathogenesis. Analysis of primary clinical specimens of WDLPS, and of the closely related dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) subtype, revealed immunohistochemical evidence of AKT activation in 27% of cases. Western blot analysis of a panel of cell lines derived from patients with WDLPS or DDLPS revealed robust AKT phosphorylation in all cell lines examined, even when these cells were cultured in serum-free media. Moreover, BEZ235, a small molecule inhibitor of PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin that effectively inhibits AKT activation in these cells, impaired viability at nanomolar concentrations. Our findings are unique in providing an animal model to decipher the molecular pathogenesis of WDLPS, and implicate AKT as a previously unexplored therapeutic target in this chemoresistant sarcoma.",

Identification of such a prognostic marker could potentially affect surgical and adjuvant therapy and\\/or follow-up surveillance for these patients. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis was utilized to characterize protein expression patterns in lipoma, atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT), and the well-differentiated components of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL). Protein spots were identified by peptide mapping\\/fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. No significant differences in protein expression were identified between lipoma and ALT or DDL. Proteins that were significantly down-regulated in the well-differentiated component of DDL compared to ALT included mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2, >3-fold reduction) and selenium-binding protein-1 (SELENBP1, >4-fold reduction). Subsequent validation studies were performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on a separate series of ALT (n\\u2009=\\u200930) and the well-differentiated components of DDL (n\\u2009=\\u200928). IHC stains were evaluated in a semi-quantitative manner, and the results were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test and receiver-operator curve analysis. Decreased IHC staining for SELENBP1 in the well-differentiated component of DDL was confirmed. Cytoplasmic ALDH2 levels determined by IHC were not significantly different in ALT and DDL; no nuclear staining for ALDH2 was observed. Expression of SELENBP1 is decreased in the well-differentiated component of DDL compared to ALT. However, variability in the staining patterns in liposarcoma precludes its use as a predictive marker for dedifferentiation.",

The parental tumor showed high leukemoid reactions. The NDDLS-1 cell line was established from a pleural effusion associated with a lung metastasis. Pleomorphic tumor cells arranged in a haphazard growth pattern were seen in xenograft tumors. Numerous inflammatory cells including neutrophils or eosinophils were present throughout the tumor cells. This finding resembled the dedifferentiated area of the parental tumor. The mice bearing NDDLS-1 showed marked leukocytosis. In addition, the NDDLS-1 cells expressed IL-6 and G-CSF at both the mRNA and protein levels, while the NDDLS-1 cells produced near normal levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\\u03B1). In the cytogenetic analysis, both the parental tumor and the NDDLS-1 cells showed a ring or giant marker chromosomes. The NDDLS-1 cell line demonstrated the amplification and expression of both MDM2 and CDK4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis. The NDDLS-1 cell line is consistent with the parental dedifferentiated liposarcoma, and it should therefore be useful for further investigations of human dedifferentiated liposarcomas.",

We investigated a series of 38 WDLPS\\/DDLPS using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with 17 probes encompassing the 12q13-15 region. In addition, using quantitative RT-PCR we studied the expression of MDM2, CDK4, DDIT3 (CHOP\\/GADD153), DYRK2, HMGA2, TSPAN31 and YEATS4 (GAS41) in 11 cases. We showed that CDK4 (12q14.1) belonged to a distinct amplicon than MDM2 (12q15). There was no continuity in the amplified sequences between MDM2 and CDK4. Moreover, while MDM2 was amplified and overexpressed in all cases, CDK4 was not amplified or overexpressed in 13% of cases. The centromeric border of the CDK4 amplicon was located immediately downstream the 5' end of DDIT3, a gene known for being involved in myxoid liposarcoma translocations. DDIT3 was amplified in 3 cases and overexpressed in 9 cases. The overexpression of DDIT3 was correlated to the CDK4 amplification and not to its own amplification status. This suggested that the CDK4 amplicon, as well as the overexpression of DDIT3, might be generated by the disruption of a fragile region in 5' DDIT3. HMGA2 was always amplified and rearranged indicating that it plays a central role in WDLPS\\/DDLPS. HMGA2 rearrangement frequently resulted in a loss of the 3' end region that is a binding site for let-7. We also found a frequent amplification and overexpression of YEATS4, an oncogene that inactivates P53, suggesting that YEATS4 might play an important role together with MDM2 in WDLPS\\/DDLPS oncogenesis.",

However, not all tumors respond favorably to these drugs. CDK4 activity is critical for progression through G1 phase and into the mitotic cell cycle. Inhibiting this kinase induces Rb-positive cells to exit the cell cycle into either a quiescent or senescent state. In this report, using well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD\\/DDLS) cell lines, we show that the proteolytic turnover of MDM2 is required for CDK4i-induced senescence. Failure to reduce MDM2 does not prevent CDK4i-induced withdrawal from the cell cycle but the cells remain in a reversible quiescent state. Reducing MDM2 in these cells drives them into the more stable senescent state. CDK4i-induced senescence associated with loss of MDM2 is also observed in some breast cancer, lung cancer and glioma cell lines indicating that this is not limited to WD\\/DDLS cells in which MDM2 is overexpressed or in cells that contain wild type p53. MDM2 turnover depends on its E3 ligase activity and expression of ATRX. Interestingly, in seven patients the changes in MDM2 expression were correlated with outcome. These insights identify MDM2 and ATRX as new regulators controlling geroconversion, the process by which quiescent cells become senescent, and this insight may be exploited to improve the activity of CDK4i in cancer therapy.",

The excised specimens contained six nodules of lipoma-like well-differentiated liposarcoma and a nodule of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The latter was composed predominantly of loosely arranged, benign-appearing spindle cells and fat cells. A small number of cells with irregularly shaped nuclei were scattered. There were no mitotic figures. The fat cells showed slight variation of size and shape, and a few multivacuolated lipoblasts were found. The spindle cell areas occupied approximately 60% of the tumor. The stroma was somewhat fibrous and myxoid and no dense collagenous matrix was found. The stroma vascularity was not prominent. Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were positive for vimentin but negative for S-100 protein, desmin, muscle actin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Follow up for 5 months showed no evidence of recurrence or metastasis. The tumor, in which the benign-appearing spindle cell component was predominant, was considered to be a low-grade dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Close and long-term follow up is required. In retroperitoneal lipoma-like well-differentiated liposarcomas, spindle cell components like the present tumor, which represent dedifferentiation, should not be overlooked.",

A 57-year-old female presented with a 5-year history of a persistent, painless swelling of the left great toe that had been previously diagnosed and treated as an in-grown toenail. After magnetic resonance imaging and core biopsy, a grade 2 pleomorphic liposarcoma was diagnosed. Treatment consisted of neoadjuvant radiotherapy and amputation of the great toe and proximal half of the first metatarsal with primary closure. The patient had no evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease after 1 year of follow-up and, with the use of a prosthesis, had a good functional outcome. This is the first documented presentation of a high-grade pleomorphic liposarcoma of the great toe to our knowledge. Although soft tissue sarcomas are rare, a high index of suspicion is required by clinicians when presented with a soft tissue mass to promptly diagnose and treat these potentially fatal lesions.",

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful with no evidence of recurrence 9 months after the operation. Surgical removal is the optimal treatment for a mediastinal liposarcoma, as it is in other sites. If the entire tumor can not be resected, surgical debulking often results in symptomatic relief. International literature suggests that recurrent disease occurs and therefore a long-term careful follow up is required.",

It showed dedifferentiation into a histological low-grade type and thus defies the traditional definition of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The excised specimen was a huge, multi-nodular encapsulated mass surrounding the kidney and infiltrating into it. The mass showed a dedifferentiated focus different in color from the surrounding tumor and containing areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. The sections from the dedifferentiated part of the tumor appeared predominantly as benign spindle cell component on histology but the tumor was infiltrating into the kidney. Hence, a close and long-term follow-up is expected in such cases though they look benign. In the retro-peritoneum, a lipoma-like well-differentiated liposarcoma with spindle cell component, like the present tumor, which shows dedifferentiation, should not be overlooked.",

A female patient presented with paraplegia. She had a previous medical history of mental depression, and complained of dorsal pain for three months following a road accident. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed a collapse of T7-T8, and the diagnosis of plasmocytoma was made. She was treated with decompressive laminectomy and posterior instrumentation. Histological examination revealed a pleomorphic liposarcoma. She received a course of radiotherapy. At 13 months follow-up she developed pulmonary metastases and rib involvement. The spine is an unusual location for pleomorphic liposarcoma, even as metastasis. The differential diagnoses of this rare entity are discussed, as well as the criteria for diagnosing primary spinal liposarcoma. Although rare, our case demonstrates that liposarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of spinal tumors.",

We have treated patients for round cell liposarcoma, an unusual histologic subtype, which is reported to be histologically mistaken for Ewing's sarcoma, lymphoma and other round cell neoplasms. The successful resection of a 2,300-g round cell liposarcoma of the omentum was recently performed at our hospital. Ultrastructural observations of this tumor are characterized by massive proliferation of the mitochondria in addition to the presence of lipid vacuoles in tumor cells. To our knowledge, no description of substantial mitochondrial proliferation in round cell liposarcoma has appeared previously in the literature; therefore, this is the first case report of histopathologic, cytopathologic and electron microscopic observations on this extremely rare tumor.",

The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor. Histopathologically, the tumor was composed of 3 parts : the largest part was compatible with an inflammatory pseudotumor: the second part, well-differentiated liposarcoma: and the third part, a myxoid liposarcoma. He has been followed up for 14 months ; but there was no evidence of local recurrence of the tumor.

The condition is associated with multiple large cervical lipomas that often require surgical excision. Comprehensive clinical examination combined with pre-operative radiographic imaging is vital in such cases to help differentiate benign fatty masses from potential liposarcomas. We describe a case in which a lipoma-like liposarcoma was identified following excision of what was expected, on clinical and radiological grounds, to be a lipoma. This case highlights the potential for sarcomatous changes in suspicious lipomas, and the key role that imaging plays in differentiating benign from malignant.",

We further investigated how calcineurin can regulate this essential post-translational modification on CDK4. In this study, we demonstrate that calcineurin can associate predominantly with the cytoplasmic form of CDK4 in the absence of cyclin D. The inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase activity resulted in the specific increase of the phosphorylation and activity levels of CDK4 within the mitotic fraction. The association of calcineurin with CDK4 peaked during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle and coincided with reduction of CDK4 phosphorylation. Using structural mutants to CDK4, we localized the interaction site of calcineurin within the amino terminal residues of CDK4 that are important for both cyclin D and p16INK4a binding. Our data suggest that calcineurin may regulate the kinase activity of CDK4 in a cell cycle-dependent manner and may be an important component of the negative regulation of CDK4.",

Myofibroblastic differentiation has been recognized in dedifferentiated liposarcoma. However, tumors closely resembling inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor have not. We report the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular finding in 6 cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor-like features treated at our institution. The tumors occurred mostly in middle age or elderly men, involved mostly the inguinal\\/scrotal region or retroperitoneum, and behaved aggressively. Microscopically, the dedifferentiated component closely resembled or, if taken out of context, was indistinguishable from inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. All 3 major patterns seen in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (myxoid, cellular, and hypocellular fibrous) were represented. Areas resembling nodular fasciitis or desmoid fibromatosis were frequent findings. One tumor had heterologous osseous differentiation. In 4 tumors the inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor-like areas were diffuse, whereas in 2 they were combined with noninflammatory myofibroblastic tumor-like high-grade sarcoma. Five tumors stained for smooth muscle actin or desmin, none stained for ALK-1, 5 stained for MDM2, and 5 had amplified MDM2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Well-differentiated liposarcomatous components were present in every tumor. All patients developed locally recurrent or metastatic disease. At last follow-up 2 patients had died of disease and 2 were alive with disease. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma can have prominent inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor-like features, a finding that further expands its histologic spectrum. Awareness of this finding can prevent one from misdiagnosing dedifferentiated liposarcoma as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, a much less aggressive neoplasm.",

A system of five subtypes was used; well-differentiated, myxoid, fibroblastic, lipoblastic, and pleomorphic liposarcomas. The 5-year treatment failure rates and survival rates were, respectively, 30% and 100% for well-differentiated, 25% and 88% for myxoid, 60% and 58% for fibroblastic, 100% and 40% for lipoblastic, and 64% and 56% for pleomorphic liposarcomas. Although local recurrence was present in all five subtypes, a significant increment in local failure was seen in patients with high-grade liposarcomas. Distant metastasis after the initial operation was not found in patients with well-differentiated liposarcoma and rare in the patients with myxoid liposarcoma. In contrast, 50% of the patients with fibroblastic, lipoblastic, and pleomorphic liposarcoma had a distant relapse within 5 years.",

One patient was irradiated with 70 Gy four years after primary surgery since she had developed an unresectable recurrence. She died eleven years later aged 79 without residual liposarcoma (autopsy). One patient aged 76 rejected a radical resection and underwent a functional tumor reduction and is alive in fairly good condition. Histologically we found one myxoid and three well-differentiated liposarcomas. Metastatic spread was not observed. Wide tumor excision is the therapy of choice. Unresectable tumors can be irradiated successfully (up to 70 Gy are necessary). Representative studies on the value of chemotherapy have not yet been presented. The main factor in clinical behavior and prognosis of this rare tumor is the histological subtype. While well-differentiated and myxoid liposarcomas show almost no metastasis and good prognosis, the pleomorphic and round cell type do metastasis, recur more often, and have a significantly worse prognosis.",

                    "abstract": "Amplification of the CDK4 gene, which encodes a key molecule in the cell cycle, has been shown in some types of human neoplasms, including bone and soft tissue tumors. It is also reported that the CDK4 gene is coamplified with other sequences in the 12q13-15 region, including the MDM2 and SAS genes. Using 146 DNA samples derived from a variety of bone and soft tissue tumors, we have studied the pattern of amplification of these three genes, CDK4, MDM2, and SAS, to investigate whether there are any tumor type specific patterns of amplification. Amplification of at least one of these three genes was found in 18 tumors, and five different patterns of amplification were observed. Amplification of all of these three genes was detected in 9 cases. Amplification of the CDK4 gene without MDM2 amplification was observed in osteosarcomas and a chondrosarcoma but not in soft tissue tumors, whereas amplification of MDM2 gene alone was observed in malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs), liposarcomas, and lipomas, but not in bone tumors. These results suggested that the CDK4 region is the primary target for amplification in bone tumors, whereas the MDM2 region is in soft tissue tumors. We also investigated the relationship of CDK4 amplification with retinoblastoma (RB) gene mutations in osteosarcomas, for which we have already performed the mutation analyses in detail. Interestingly, contrary to the prevailing theory that CDK4 amplification is an alternative mechanism for RB gene mutation, we found that three of four cases with amplification of the CDK4 gene showed loss of expression of the RB protein, one of which was proved to have an gross DNA alteration in the RB locus. This redundancy of mutations may indicate that the amplification of CDK4 may have some roles other than the inactivation of the RB protein in the development of osteosarcomas.",

Cdc37 is not an inhibitor nor an activator of the Cdk4\\/cyclin D1 kinase, while it appears to facilitate complex assembly between Cdk4, and cyclin D1 in vitro. Cdc37 competes with p16 for binding to Cdk4, suggesting that p16 might exert part of its inhibitory function by affecting the formation of Cdk4\\/cyclin D1 complexes via Cdc37.",

Differences in the accumulation of these radionuclides may reflect differences in cell densities, fatty acid metabolism, and the degree of malignancy. I-123 BMIPP and Ga-67 scintigraphy may be useful in determining the prognosis of liposarcoma.",

Apc(+\\/Min) mice when crossed with Ink4a\\/arf-\\/- mice, exhibited increased angiogenesis of colorectal tumors suggesting that dysregulation of Cdk4 (due to loss of Ink4a-mediated suppression) may contribute to enhanced angiogenesis. To demonstrate a direct role for Cdk4 in angiogenesis, we crossed mice that have an activated Cdk4, Cdk4(R24C\\/R24C) mice, with Apc(+\\/Min) mice and examined levels of angiogenesis in intestinal tumors formed. Our results show an increase in the percentage of highly vascularized tumors in Cdk4(R24C\\/R24C):Apc(Min\\/+) and Cdk4(+\\/R24C):Apc(Min\\/+) mice compared to Cdk4(+\\/+):Apc(Min\\/+) mice. In addition immunohistochemical analysis showed an increase in CD-31 staining localized to endothelial cells of Cdk4(R24C\\/R24C):Apc(Min\\/+) mouse tumors, supporting the hypothesis of increased vasculature in these tumors. Further analysis showed an increase in the expression of the E2F1 target proteins Vegf-b and Cyclin A in Cdk4(R24C\\/R24C):Apc(+\\/Min) intestinal tumors. Together these data suggest that the dysregulated Cdk4 gene plays an important role in angiogenesis during intestinal tumor formation and may in part act via increasing E2F1 target proteins. This is the first report to show that Cdk4 has a direct role in angiogenesis in vivo and may be an important drug target to reduce or prevent angiogenesis during intestinal tumor formation.",

Two patients, men 54 and 66 years of age, had retroperitoneal atypical lipomatous tumors (well-differentiated liposarcomas) that recurred (after 2.5 and 12 years, respectively) as dedifferentiated liposarcomas with rhabdomyosarcomatous elements in the dedifferentiated components. The third patient, a 63-year-old woman, had a retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma whose dedifferentiated component demonstrated focal osteoid formation. The fourth patient, a 36-year-old woman, had two seemingly separate retroperitoneal masses, one composed of atypical lipomatous tumor with foci of smooth muscle and the other of leiomyosarcoma; despite the apparent separation, it was thought more logical to consider this a dedifferentiated liposarcoma with leiomyosarcoma as the dedifferentiated component than two unrelated neoplasms. The fifth patient, a 45-year-old man, had a mediastinal dedifferentiated liposarcoma with angiosarcomatous areas in the dedifferentiated component. The relatively short follow-up thus far available on these cases has not demonstrated tumor behavior significantly different from that of dedifferentiated liposarcoma as a whole.",

Computed tomography revealed the presence of a large mass presenting a dishomogeneous density with an adipose component, probably of mesenteric origin. A xifopubic laparotomy confirmed the presence of a pedunculated growth originating from the mesentery. The mass was removed and the histopathological report noted a well differentiated sclerosing liposarcoma with the peritoneal liquid positive for malignant cells. Surgery currently represents the only possibly curative therapy for this type of tumour but close long-term follow up and accurate evaluation of the clinicopathologic parameters are needed.",

Here, we investigate both in vivo and in vitro the mechanism by which Cdk4 expression is regulated in the context of cyclin D1 over-expression. Cdk4 mRNA levels in cyclin D1-over-expressing tissue and cultured cells were unchanged compared with controls. In contrast, Cdk4 protein levels were increased in cyclin D1-over-expressing tissue and cells versus their respective controls. This increase was not due to altered protein stability, but appeared to be due to an increase in Cdk4 protein synthesis. We also performed immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays to demonstrate an increase in cyclin D1-Cdk4 complex formation and associated kinase activity. Blocking cyclin D1 expression resulted in diminished Cdk4 protein but not mRNA levels. These findings suggest a mechanism by which Cdk4 expression is increased in the context of cyclin D1 over-expression during tumourigenesis.",

The histopathologic examination of the specimen revealed liposarcoma. The tumor cells were diffusely and intensively immune reactive for vimentin and S-100, and negative for smooth muscle actin, desmin, h-caldesmon, pan cytokeratin, and CD10. Staining with periodic acid and Schiff, alcian blue, mucicarmine, and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) were negative. No recurrence was detected in the postoperative seventh month.

                    "abstract": "Atypical lipomatous tumours (ALTs) represent a distinctive subset of mesenchymal neoplasms featuring mature adipocytic differentiation. Most ALTs are characterized cytogenetically by the presence of supernumerary ring and\\/or long marker chromosomes derived from the chromosomal region 12q13-15. The 12q13-15 chromosome region contains several genes which may play an important role in human tumorigenesis. A series of ALTs was analysed by investigating the MDM2, CDK4, and HMGI-C genes and their proteins. The study was extended to a series of ordinary lipomas, to determine whether the immunohistochemical investigation of these gene products might play any diagnostic role. Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of various cytogenetic aberrations involving the 12q13-15 region in 11\\/18 (61%) lipomas and of ring chromosomes in all ALTs. Overexpression of mdm2 protein was observed in 6\\/12 (50%) atypical lipomatous tumours. All lipomas were mdm2-negative. cdk4 overexpression was present in 100% of ALTs. Weak cdk4 immunopositivity was detected in 2\\/18 (11%) ordinary lipomas in a minority of cells. HMGI-C immunopositivity was observed in 10\\/12 (83%) ALTs. Positive immunoreactivity was also observed in 8\\/18 (44%) lipomas. Southern blot analysis revealed amplification of the CDK4 and MDM2 genes in 3\\/5 ALTs analysed. HMGI-C was amplified in 3\\/5 cases and was deleted in one case. Mutation analysis of the CDK4 gene did not demonstrate any mutation. These data support the hypothesis that ordinary lipomas may form a molecular genetic and morphological continuum with ALT. At one end of the spectrum are lipomas characterized by 12q13-15 rearrangements and HMGI-C activation and at the other end are ALTs with ring chromosomes, 12q13-15 amplification with overrepresentation of the HMGI-C, CDK4 or MDM2 genes, and aberrant cdk4, mdm2, and HMGI-C protein expression. These findings not only provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of lipomatous tumours, but also indicate that the immunohistochemical analysis of mdm2 and cdk4 may help to increase diagnostic accuracy.",

LS is subdivided into four distinct subtypes: well-differentiated, myxoid\\/round cell, pleomorphic, and mixed LS. In addition to distinctive morphology, each of the subgroups has a different prognosis and treatment strategy. While subgrouping has traditionally been based on conventional morphology, recent molecular and cytogenetic findings have validated the current classification system. Well-differentiated LS is characterized by overexpression of MDM2, which blocks the tumor suppressor function of p53. Myxoid\\/round cell LS is characterized by a specific translocation resulting in a fusion protein which interferes with adipocyte differentiation. Pleomorphic LS, like other high grade sarcomas, is characterized by multiple chromosomal abnormalities. Each of these distinctive molecular signatures can be exploited to aid in the subtyping of LS and in distinguishing true sarcomas of lipogenic derivation from benign mimics.",

We showed that Cdk4(-\\/-) mice had impaired recruitment of lymphocytes following bleomycin model of acute lung injury. In this study, we characterized the development and function of hematopoietic cells in Cdk4(-\\/-) mice and assessed the response of Cdk4(-\\/-) mice to allergen challenge. Cdk4(-\\/-) mice had hypoplastic thymuses with decreased total thymocyte cell numbers and increased CD4\\/CD8 double negative cells. Cdk4(-\\/-) bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice showed similar findings. Thymocytes from either Cdk4(-\\/-) or Cdk4(-\\/-) BM chimeric mice proliferated equally well as wild type controls in response to IL-2 activation. However Cdk4(-\\/-) thymocytes had decreased adhesion to both endothelial cell matrix and fibronectin compared to wildtype (WT) controls, whereas Cdk4(-\\/-) and WT splenocytes had similar adhesion. When Cdk4(-\\/-) BM chimeric mice and wild type BM chimeric mice were sensitized and challenged by intranasal administration of ovalbumin, we found no differences in allergic responses in the lung and airways between the two groups, as measured by inflammatory cell infiltrate, airway hyperreactivity, IgE levels and cytokine levels. In summary, we show that Cdk4 plays a previously unrecognized role in thymocyte maturation and adhesion, but is not required for thymocyte proliferation. In addition, Cdk4 is not required for lymphocyte trafficking to the lung following allergen sensitization and challenge.",

Since the histopathology of the laryngeal and the previous liposarcoma were different, the question of metastasis versus multicentricity was raised. Other discussions of liposarcomas over the past three decades have not resolved this aspect of their behavior completely. In this instance, after considering avenues of metastatic spread in conjuction with the histopathology, it would appear that the laryngeal lesion was a second primary and not a metastasis.",

Although overexpression of these protooncogenes might inhibit growth regulation through the TP53- and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB)-mediated pathways, neither gene was included consistently in all of the amplicons observed in our sarcoma panel. It was unclear whether both of these genes were selected for during amplification. Furthermore, in some samples without amplification of MDM2 or CDK4, comparative genomic hybridization showed amplification in the 12q13-15 region, suggesting that another selection mechanism might also be involved. To investigate the possibility that another target gene, which may be located between CDK4 and MDM2, could be the driving force, we characterized the involvement of 17 loci from this region in 12q13-15 amplicons that were detected previously in 21 sarcoma samples. The results showed discrete amplicons around MDM2 and CDK4 with reduced amplification of the intervening sequences. This suggests that there is separate selection for amplification of the two genes, and it makes the possibility of a common selective gene unlikely. Furthermore, D12S8, localized distal to MDM2, was amplified almost as frequently as MDM2 and was also amplified in one of the samples without MDM2 or CDK4 amplification. The data suggest that amplification of at least three different regions within the 12q13-15 segment may be selected for in tumor cells involving MDM2, CDK4, or a more distally located gene, possibly near D12S8.",

In order to investigate the physiological role of miR-124 in bladder cancer, target genes of miR-124 were predicted by the TargetScan software, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK4), which has been implicated as a regulator of cell cycle, was chosen for further study. MiR-124 could significantly repress CDK4 expression by targeting its binding site in the 3'UTR of CDK4 in vitro. In both bladder cancer cell lines and tissues, the expression of miR-124 was significantly down-regulated, while CDK4 expression was up-regulated. Ectopic expression of miR-124 in transplanted HT1197 cells resulted in the retardation of tumor growth in mouse tumor xenografts. And the expression of miR-124 and CDK4 showed an obvious inverse correlation in these xenograft tissues, which was also observed in human bladder cancer tissue samples. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that miR-124 can arrest cell cycle and restrain the growth of bladder cancer by targeting CDK4 directly.",

We encountered a case of amelanotic melanoma with a concurrent liposarcoma. A 68-year-old man presented with a single, 1.5x1.5 cm round erythematous, eroded nodule on the left heel. A biopsy specimen showed atypical, pleomorphic tumor cells with little melanin pigment. The tumor cells were positive for S-100, HMB-45 and negative for cytokeratins. These findings were consistent with amelanotic melanoma. On positron emission tomography\\/computed tomography (PET\\/CT), a hypermetabolic lesion was found in the left buttock. This lesion was excised and diagnosed as a well-differentiated liposarcoma. An association between sarcomas and other primary malignancies has been reported.

Furthermore, it is observed that up-regulation of CDK4 is associated with therapy resistance and relapse. However, the mechanisms behind these phenomena remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that elevated CDK4 expression is correlated with poor prognosis in glioma after radiotherapy and that CDK4 knockdown conferred radiosensitivity in glioma cell lines. CDK4 was identified as potential downstream target of miR-124 through bioinformatics analysis and dual-firefly luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, restoration of miR-124 could confer radiosensitivity. Cell differentiation agent-2 (CDA-2) mimicked the effect of miR-124 restoration and CDK4 knockdown, and sensitized xenografts to radiation in an animal model. Our findings demonstrated for the first time that CDK4 was a downstream target of miR-124 and that CDA-2 could radiosensitize Glioblastoma multiforme cells through the MiR-124-CDK4 axis.",

Neither radiography nor ultrasonography detected the actual association of the tumor with the abdominal viscera before surgery. A large-sized tumor mass that adhered to the mesojejunoileum was explored by laparatomy. Final diagnosis of a pleomorphic liposarcoma was made by the routine histology and further identified by Oil Red O stain. The two single-agent chemotherapy including doxorubicin followed by capecitabine, however, failed to cause remission of the intrahepatic metastatic lesions.

In this report, we present a new case of giant esophageal liposarcoma in a 49-year-old woman with a family history of upper gastrointestinal tract cancer. This was a transmural tumor located in the lower esophagus. Subtotal esophagectomy was successfully performed, and histopathology revealed a well-differentiated liposarcoma. The patient was followed-up for 20 months without recurrence. However, asynchronous ovarian serous adenocarcinoma was found 1 year after the esophageal surgery, and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome was diagnosed.",

Optimal management of the tumour recurrence includes complete re-excision and radiotherapy to the area of recurrence. Here, we describe a 48-year-old man with a recurrent left paratesticular well-differentiated liposarcoma, six years after its complete excision.

Cyclin D\\/CDK4 complex phosphorylates retinoblastoma gene product and p16 inhibits CDK4 in competition with cyclin D. Aberrant expression of these proteins may deregulate cell proliferation and moreover may lead to tumor formation and progression. In this study we examined the expression of cyclin D, CDK4 and p16 in adenoma-carcinoma sequence of colorectum. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that cyclin D was overexpressed in 55 of 66 (83%) adenomas, 8 of 8 (100%) carcinomas in adenoma (CIAs), 26 of 45 (58%) advanced carcinomas and even in hyperplastic mucosa. CDK4 was overexpressed in 0 of 52 (0%) adenomas, 0 of 14 (0%) CIAs and 39 of 45 (87%) advanced carcinomas, but not in hyperplastic mucosa. p16 was overexpressed in only 5 of 52 (10%) adenomas, 10 of 14 (71%) CIA and 59 of 60 (98%) advanced carcinomas, but not in hyperplastic mucosa. And comparative study of CDK4 and p16 showed that CDK4-positive cancer cells also expressed p16. Western blot analysis also revealed that primary regions of advanced colorectal cancer tissues showed 4.61, 3.30, 1.65 and 8.03-fold overexpression on the average in cyclin D1, cyclin D2, CDK4 and p16 respectively. These results indicate that both cyclin D and CDK4 may contribute to phosphorylation of pRB. p16 overexpression would be induced as a brake at G1\\/S transition through pRB phosphorylation by CDK4 overexpression in advanced colorectal carcinomas.",

Here, we report that CDK4 deficiency markedly accelerated lymphoma development in the E\\u03BC-Myc transgenic mouse model of B lymphoma and that silencing or loss of CDK4 augmented the tumorigenic potential of Myc-driven mouse and human B cell lymphoma in transplant models. Accelerated disease in CDK4-deficient E\\u03BC-Myc transgenic mice was associated with rampant genomic instability that was provoked by dysregulation of a FOXO1\\/RAG1\\/RAG2 pathway. Specifically, CDK4 phosphorylated and inactivated FOXO1, which prevented FOXO1-dependent induction of Rag1 and Rag2 transcription. CDK4-deficient E\\u03BC-Myc B cells had high levels of the active form of FOXO1 and elevated RAG1 and RAG2. Furthermore, overexpression of RAG1 and RAG2 accelerated lymphoma development in a transplant model, with RAG1\\/2-expressing tumors exhibiting hallmarks of genomic instability. Evaluation of human tumor samples revealed that CDK4 expression was markedly suppressed, while FOXO1 expression was elevated, in several subtypes of human non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma. Collectively, these findings establish a context-specific tumor suppressor function for CDK4 that prevents genomic instability, which contributes to B cell lymphoma. Furthermore, our data suggest that targeting CDK4 may increase the risk for the development and\\/or progression of lymphoma.",

Mutations in the Cdk4 gene conferring INK4 resistance are associated with familial and sporadic melanoma in humans and result in a wide spectrum of tumors in mice, suggesting that INK4 is a major regulator of CDK4. Mice lacking the Cdk4 gene exhibit various defects in many organs associated with hypocellularity, whereas loss of the p18(Ink4c) gene results in widespread hyperplasia and organomegaly. To genetically test the notion that the function of INK4 is dependent on CDK4, we generated p18; Cdk4 double-mutant mice and examined the organs and tissues which developed abnormalities when either gene is deleted. We show here that, in all organs we have examined, including pituitary, testis, pancreas, kidney, and adrenal gland, hyperproliferative phenotypes associated with p18 loss were canceled. The double-mutant mice exhibited phenotypes very close to or indistinguishable from that of Cdk4 single-mutant mice. Mice lacking p27(Kip1) develop widespread hyperplasia and organomegaly similar to those developed by p18-deficient mice. The p27; Cdk4 double-mutant mice, however, displayed phenotypes intermediate between those of p27 and Cdk4 single-mutant mice. These results provide genetic evidence that in mice p18(Ink4c) and p27(Kip1) mediate the transduction of different cell growth and proliferation signals to CDK4 and that p18(Ink4c) is functionally dependent on CDK4.",

We report a case of mediatinal pleomorphic liposarcoma in a 37-year-old man who complained of chest pain. Computed tomography showed an anterior expansive process within the mediastinum. Histological diagnosis was established by a trans-thoracic computed tomography guided core-needle biopsy. Despite a first cure of chemotherapy with gemcitabin\\/cisplatin, disease progression led to death 3 months after diagnosis. Mediastinal pleomorphic liposarcoma is an exceptional invading tumor affecting the middle-aged adult. This tumor, usually giant, becomes symptomatic by compression of mediastinal structures. Surgery is the best treatment when possible. The role of radiotherapy and chemotherapy are discussed. Prognosis depends both on the quality of resection and the grade malignancy.",

Liposarcoma is currently classified into the types of well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, pleomorphic and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Up to now only a few cases of esophagus liposarcoma have been described in the world literature. We describe a myxoid type liposarcoma of the esophagus in a 68 year old man presented with hoarseness and intermittent dysphagea to solid food. He had a huge mass in his mouth which was mobile with gag reflex. A barium swallow, esophageal manometery and CT scan of the esophagus have not clearly revealed the mass. After endoscopic surgical resection of the tumor the histological examination revealed a myxoid liposarcoma. Both the presenting signs and symptoms and the histology type are rare for such tumor. This case demonstrate a rare differential diagnosis of intermittent dysphagia as early diagnosis is so important in those tumors and should kept in mind them, although they are quite rare.",

                    "abstract": "For proper development and tissue homeostasis, cell cycle progression is controlled by multilayered mechanisms. Recent studies using knock-out mice have shown that animals can develop relatively normally with deficiency for each of the G1\\/S-regulatory proteins, D-type and E-type cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), and Cdk2. Although Cdk4-null mice show no embryonic lethality, they exhibit specific endocrine phenotypes, i.e. dwarfism, infertility, and diabetes. Here we have demonstrated that Cdk4 plays an essential non-redundant role in postnatal proliferation of the anterior pituitary. Pituitaries from wild-type and Cdk4-null embryos at embryonic day 17.5 are morphologically indistinguishable with similar numbers of cells expressing a proliferating marker, Ki67, and cells expressing a differentiation marker, growth hormone. In contrast, anterior pituitaries of Cdk4-null mice at postnatal 8 weeks are extremely hypoplastic with markedly decreased numbers of Ki67+ cells, suggesting impaired cell proliferation. Pituitary hyperplasia induced by transgenic expression of human growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is significantly diminished in the Cdk4+\\/- genetic background and completely abrogated in the Cdk4-\\/- background. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Cdk4 inhibits GHRH-induced proliferation of GH3 somato\\/lactotroph cells with restored expression of GHRH receptors. Cdk4 siRNA also inhibits estrogen-dependent cell proliferation in GH3 cells and closely related GH4 cells. In contrast, Cdk6 siRNA does not diminish proliferation of these cells. Furthermore, Cdk4 siRNA does not affect GHRH-induced proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts or estrogen-dependent proliferation of mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells. Taken together, Cdk4 is dispensable for prenatal development of the pituitary or proliferation of other non-endocrine tissues but indispensable specifically for postnatal proliferation of somato\\/lactotrophs.",

However, the mechanisms through which c-MYC achieves these effects have been unclear. Using serial analysis of gene expression, we have identified the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) gene as a transcriptional target of c-MYC. c-MYC induced a rapid increase in CDK4 mRNA levels through four highly conserved c-MYC binding sites within the CDK4 promoter. Cell-cycle progression is delayed in c-MYC-deficient RAT1 cells, and this delay was associated with a defect in CDK4 induction. Ectopic expression of CDK4 in these cells partially alleviated the growth defect. Thus, CDK4 provides a direct link between the oncogenic effects of c-MYC and cell-cycle regulation.",

A 60-year-old man came to our hospital with the chief complaint of a phyma in the right anterior chest wall. On palpation, a hard and non-mobile phyma measuring 3 x 3 cm was felt in the chest wall. Chest CT showed a phyma measuring 2.2 x 1.5 cm in the right anterior chest. The periphery of the phyma was smooth, and had a well-defined boundary with the surrounding tissues. Ultrasonic examination revealed that the tumor existed between the major and minor pectoral muscles. The inside of the tumor was nearly uniform, and showed low echo. Punctured cytological examination revealed scattered atypical cells with spindle, foamy or vacuolar sporophores on the mucoid matrix. A fat staining examination revealed lipoblasts with oil red-positive granules. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having myxoid type liposarcoma. Operation consisted of resection of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, mammary gland, part of major and minor pectoral muscles, the fourth and fifth ribs and pleura. The Reconstruction of the chest wall was performed for defects in the ribs and pleura using Marlex Mesh. Histopathological findings revealed that the tumor was myxoid type liposarcoma.",

The patient presented at Internal Medicine Unit in May 2004, to study of thyroid pathology. The clinical examination was normal, except for the finding of an asymptomatic mass in the abdomen. The patient knew the existence of tumor since time ago, but she confesses to have only occasional discomfort. In the abdominal ultrasonography a solid mass with large cystic component was detected but relation with other organs was not clear. Computed tomography revealed the presence of a mass with solid and cystic components, in contact with small intestine in the left side of abdomen. A complete resection of tumor arising from mesentery of jejunum was performed successfully with end to end anastomosis. The gross specimen was lobulated and measured 8.5 x 7.5 cm. The histopathology analysis showed proliferating lipoblasts with irregular nuclei on a myxoid background, with plexiform vascular pattern, characteristics belongs to myxoid type liposarcoma. The patient is alive and well one year after removal of tumor. The uncommon site and the exceptional cystic morphology of tumor are discussed, and so it must be included the primary mesenteric liposarcoma in the differential diagnosis of intra-abdominal tumors with cystic large areas.",

Second surgery was performed to completely remove the liposarcoma tissue and repair a coincident old right lumbar region hernia. The patient recovered  fully. Spontaneous rupture of the diaphragm is rare and this is especially true for the right hemidiaphragm.

The liposarcomas were divided into 4 main subtypes according to WHO's recommended classification (1969): well-differentiated (33 cases), myxoid (22 cases), rundcell (14 cases) and pleomorphic types (21 cases). When predominantly well-differentiated or myxoid liposarcomas contained areas of round-cell or pleomorphic types (24 and 8 cases, respectively), they were classified separately, thus adding 2 further subtypes to our classification. The validity of this histologic classification was emphasized by the prognostic study, based on a 10 year follow-up. The differential diagnosis for each of the 4 main subtypes is discussed. Three well-differentiated, lipoma-like liposarcomas which contained highly vascular hibernoma-like areas are described. Two well-differentiated liposarcomas situated in the neck and upper part of the back, respectively, of elderly patients included area similar to \\\"spindle-cell lipoma\\\" (Enzinger).

Low-grade liposarcomas are the most frequent and least aggressive and are noted as having a low risk of metastasis. We present a case of low-grade myxoid liposarcoma that metastasized to the small bowel resulting in intussusception. This case involves a 44-year-old woman with a recurrent retroperitoneal liposarcoma. Approximately 30 months after initial diagnosis, the patient was found to have a solitary metastasis to the small bowel that presented as a jejunal intussusception. Interestingly, there was no indication of a round cell component in either the metastasis or recurrent tumor, although the original tumor did contain a small round cell component. This is the first report in the English literature of liposarcoma metastasizing to the small bowel. We suggest that atypical presentations of liposarcoma metastases should always be considered in the management of patients with a history of liposarcoma.",

Lipoblastic liposarcoma is an extremely rare tumor when it occurs in the pediatric neck. Hudson and Saunders in their studies have shown that only 3 patients with this tumor have been reported since 1944. When a 5-year-old female presented with this primary neck mass, questions of diagnosis and treatment were raised. The following case report and discussion will demonstrate the diagnostic methods as well as the course of therapy followed in this type of lesion.",

Unfortunately, disease recurs within a median of 3-4 years, presenting as castration resistant PCa (CRPC), for which there are limited therapeutic options. This emphasizes the need for more efficacious drugs and a patient-tailored approach towards cancer therapy to improve disease outcome. One class of drugs currently tested clinically, Cdk4\\/6 kinase inhibitors, blocks phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor, thereby boosting its function, and likely preventing castration resistance. As Cdk4\\/6 inhibitor resistance has already been reported in other cancers, some PCa patients are anticipated to develop drug resistance. Here, we created palbociclib-resistant PCa cell models by continuously culturing them in presence of the drug to unravel mechanisms of acquired resistance, and assessed them for cross-resistance to ribociclib and response to other therapeutics. While the parental PCa cell models, Cdk4\\/6 inhibitors efficiently induce a G1 cell cycle arrest, the resistant cell lines bypass this cell cycle checkpoint. Although loss of RB is a known mechanism for Cdk4\\/6i resistance, none of the models lost RB expression. Strikingly, these originally hormone-sensitive cell lines, upon developing Cdk4\\/6 inhibitor resistance display altered response to selected therapeutic regimens. Mechanisms of resistance, as informed by Whole Exome Sequencing and RNASeq, will be discussed."

The omentum was increased and quite infiltrated by the tumour. Single tumour foci consisted of structures reminding of a malignant neurogenous tumour, malignant fibrous histiocytoma and haemangiopericytoma. Some areas with a rather oval tumour cells with poor cohesivity reminded of a malignant lymphoma but were without any immunohistochemical positivity with markers proper for ML. A series of other tumours were to be eliminated in differential diagnostic consideration, i.e. sarcomatoid carcinoma, GIST, secondaries of a sarcomatoid variant of melanoma, malignant schwannoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, peritoneal leiomyomatosis. The prevalence of dedifferentiated structures can mostly veil the diagnosis of liposarcoma and immunohistochemical results are not always constant. A transition between well differentiated liposarcoma and its dedifferentiated structures are to be found in a single section for correct diagnosis. Prognosis of the dedifferentiated liposarcoma is presumed to be better than that of pleiomorphic sarcomas.

We describe the cyto-genetic and molecular cytogenetic findings of giant DDLS arising in the right thigh of an 83-year-old woman. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass composed of two components with heterogeneous signal intensities, suggesting the coexistence of a fatty area and another soft tissue component. A wide resection of the tumor was performed. The resected, grossly heterogeneous mass, measuring 26x18x8 cm, was histopathologically composed of a well-differentiated liposarcomatous component transitioning abruptly into a dedifferentiated one. Cytogenetic analysis exhibited a complex karyotype with several numerical and structural alterations, including ring and giant marker chromosomes. Metaphase-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis showed high-level amplifications of 1q21-q25 and 12q13-q21. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed MDM2 and CDK4 gene amplification in both the well-differentiated and dedifferentiated components. These findings indicate that DDLS of the extremity shares a similar genetic background to retroperitoneal DDLS.",

Without the administration of gadolinium contrast material, the tumor may even mimic a cystic tumor. A spectrum of MR imaging abnormalities occur in myxoid liposarcoma, depending on the amount of fat and myxoid material, the degree of cellularity and vascularity, and the presence of necrosis. Most myxoid liposarcomas have lacy or linear, amorphous foci of fat. Some myxoid liposarcomas appear to be cystic at nonenhanced MR imaging, although they enhance like other solid masses at contrast material-enhanced MR imaging. The enhancing areas within the tumor represent increased cellularity and vascularity; the nonenhancing areas represent necrosis, reduced cellularity, and accumulated mucinous material. Gadolinium-enhanced imaging is important in differentiating myxoid liposarcoma from benign cystic tumors. Characterization of the tumor with MR imaging plays an important role in the management of myxoid liposarcoma.",

The ultrasonography of the mass showed almost homogenous and relatively low intensity echogram. The mass which derived from the left spermatic cord and was partially surrounded by fat-like soft and yellow tissue, was removed with the left testis by usual orchiectomy. Histopathological diagnosis was liposarcoma, whose subtype was dedifferentiated type derived from well differentiated type. Postoperatively, a para-aortic mass, which resembled lymphnode metastasis, was pointed by computed tomographic scan and was removed surgically. However, it was histopathologically diagnosed as neurogenicganglioma irrelevant to liposarcoma. He has been free of disease for about 1 year without any adjuvant therapy.",

Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) mediates with D-type cyclins entry of cells into cell cycle in response to external stimuli. CDK4 plays a role in body weight, adipogenesis, and beta cell proliferation. CDK4 null mice develop type 2 diabetes (T2D). Furthermore, CDK4 variants are associated with obesity-associated tumors\\/cancer. We aimed at identifying a role of CDK4 IVS4-nt40G --> A variant in T2D-associated obesity (body mass index, BMI > or = 30) by association tests in an Italian T2D subjects dataset. We recruited from Italy 128 unrelated T2D subjects with BMI <30 kg\\/m(2) and 54 unrelated T2D subjects with BMI > or = 30 kg\\/m(2). We performed statistical power calculations in our dataset. DNA samples were directly sequenced with specific primers for CDK4 IVS4-nt40G --> A variant. We identified a significant association of the G allele with T2D-associated obesity and of the A allele with T2D-associated BMI < 30. In our study, we found that the CDK4 IVS4-nt40GG genotype is a risk variant for T2D-associated obesity and that the AA genotype is associated with BMI < 30 in T2D. Hence, CDK4 IVS4-nt40A allele is protective and G allele confers risk for obesity in T2D patients. This study should prompt further work aiming at establishing CDK4 role in contributing to human obesity and T2D-associated obesity.",

                    "abstract": "Mammalian cells are able to sense environmental oxidative and genotoxic conditions such as the environmental low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) present naturally on the earth's surface. The stressed cells then can induce a so-called radioadaptive response with an enhanced cellular homeostasis and repair capacity against subsequent similar genotoxic conditions such as a high dose radiation. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a primary mitochondrial antioxidant in mammals, has long been known to play a crucial role in radioadaptive protection by detoxifying O2(\\u2022-) generated by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast to the well-studied mechanisms of SOD2 gene regulation, the mechanisms underlying posttranslational regulation of MnSOD for radioprotection remain to be defined. Herein, we demonstrate that cyclin D1\\/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) serves as the messenger to deliver the stress signal to mitochondria to boost mitochondrial homeostasis in human skin keratinocytes under LDIR-adaptive radioprotection. Cyclin D1\\/CDK4 relocates to mitochondria at the same time as MnSOD enzymatic activation peaks without significant changes in total MnSOD protein level. The mitochondrial-localized CDK4 directly phosphorylates MnSOD at serine-106 (S106), causing enhanced MnSOD enzymatic activity and mitochondrial respiration. Expression of mitochondria-targeted dominant negative CDK4 or the MnSOD-S106 mutant reverses LDIR-induced mitochondrial enhancement and adaptive protection. The CDK4-mediated MnSOD activation and mitochondrial metabolism boost are also detected in skin tissues of mice receiving in vivo whole-body LDIR. These results demonstrate a unique CDK4-mediated mitochondrial communication that allows cells to sense environmental genotoxic stress and boost mitochondrial homeostasis by enhancing phosphorylation and activation of MnSOD.",

Patients included 13 males and 11 females, with an age range of 3 to 72 years (median 58). Nine tumors were located in the anterior mediastinum, 7 in the posterior mediastinum, 1 in the superior mediastinum, and the precise location was not specified in 7 cases. Of the anterior mediastinal tumors, 3 appeared to arise from the thymus. Tumors were well-circumscribed, multinodular masses and ranged in size from 2.2 to 61 cm in greatest dimension (median 16 cm). Histologic examination revealed that most of the cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas (10), followed by dedifferentiated liposarcomas (8), pleomorphic liposarcomas (4), and myxoid liposarcomas (2). Of the pleomorphic liposarcomas, 2 had areas that resembled myxofibrosarcoma with atypical hyperchromatic spindle cells in a myxoid stroma, but the focal presence of lipoblasts confirmed the diagnoses. Clinical follow-up was obtained in 15 cases (range 1 to 59 mo; median 26). Complete surgical excision was attempted in 13 patients; however, local recurrence was common (5 cases), including 1 patient whose tumor recurred twice. Eleven patients were alive with no evidence of disease at last follow-up (5 well-differentiated, 5 dedifferentiated, and 1 myxoid liposarcoma). Two patients developed distant metastases (dedifferentiated and pleomorphic liposarcoma). One patient was alive with disease (pleomorphic liposarcoma), and 2 died of disease (pleomorphic and dedifferentiated liposarcoma). Overall, mediastinal liposarcomas appear to be similar, in clinicopathologic terms, to liposarcomas arising in the retroperitoneum.",

Otherwise than commonly advised, the treatment is suitable to be performed under local anaesthesia and the patient easily and safely discharged few hours after surgery.",

Histopathologically they often show intratumor heterogeneity. In some cases, differential diagnosis of liposarcoma and MFH is difficult. It has been reported that myxoid liposarcomas are characterized by chromosomal translocation t (12; 16) (q13; p11), and that this results in two types (type I and type II) of FUS\\/TLS-CHOP fusion transcripts. In this study, the FUS\\/TLS-CHOP chimeric transcripts in seven malignant soft tissue tumors of Asian patients were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, DNA blot hybridization and nucleotide sequencing. One myxoid liposarcoma and two round cell liposarcomas possessed a chimeric transcript whose fusion point was the same as that of the type I fusion transcript reported previously for myxoid liposarcoma. We were thus able to detect the type I FUS\\/TLS-CHOP fusion transcript in clinical specimens of liposarcoma from Asian patients, including the first examples of round cell liposarcoma. These results suggest that the detection of FUS\\/TLS-CHOP chimeric transcripts or chimeric genes can be used as a diagnostic tool for the pathological diagnosis of liposarcomas.",

The first, CDKN2A, is a tumour suppressor gene with germline mutations detected in 20% of melanoma-prone families. The second, CDK4, is an oncogene with co-segregating germline mutations detected in only three kindreds worldwide. We examined 16 American melanoma-prone families for mutations in all coding exons of CDK4 and screened additional members of two previously reported families with the Arg24Cys germline CDK4 mutation to evaluate the penetrance of the mutation. No new CDK4 mutations were identified. In the two Arg24Cys families, the penetrance was estimated to be 63%. Overall, 12 out of 12 invasive melanoma patients, none out of one in situ melanoma patient, five out of 13 dysplastic naevi patients, two out of 15 unaffected family members, and none out of 10 spouses carried the Arg24Cys mutation. Dysplastic naevi did not strongly co-segregate with the Arg24Cys mutation. Thus the phenotype observed in melanoma-prone CDK4 families appears to be more complex than just the CDK4 mutation. Both genetic and environmental factors are likely to contribute to the occurrence of melanoma and dysplastic naevi in these families. In summary, although CDK4 is a melanoma susceptibility gene, it plays a minor role in hereditary melanoma.",

Myxoid liposarcoma may be distinguished on the basis of its homogeneous or mildly heterogeneous structure due to the large amounts of the extracellular myxoid material that give it its typical MR appearance. Both well-differentiated and myxoid liposarcomas, the most common types accounting for about 50% of all liposarcomas, have a more favourable clinical behaviour than the other histological types. Differentiation of these from the other histological types of liposarcoma therefore has a high significance for prognosis and therapeutical approach. On the basis of our experience and of the literature, we believe that diagnostic imaging and in particular the MR examination may lead to a correct diagnosis.",

A 53-year-old man visited our hospital because of a mass, 12x8cm in diameter, in the right upper abdomen.

A part of the tumor protruded into the colon in the upper portion of the ascending colon. The tumor was surgically resected by right hemicolectomy. Histological diagnosis of the tumor was well-differentiated liposarcoma, sclerosing variant. Radiological findings seemed to reflect the pathological findings well.",

In this study, we used a mouse model to attempt to confirm this hypothesis, finding that cyclin D1 and cdk4 played active roles in not only the tumor but also the tumor microenvironment. Loss of cdk4 blocked tumor development, but loss of cyclin D1 did not prevent gliomas from developing. Instead, loss of cyclin D1 impeded progression to higher stages of malignancy. Enforcing expression of cyclin D1 was insufficient to correct the progression defect observed in cyclin D1-deficient animals. In contrast, restoration of cdk4 in the cdk4-deficient animals restored cell proliferation and tumor formation, although at lower tumor grades. Notably, the failure of tumors in the cyclin D1- and cdk4-deficient animals to progress to higher grades was correlated with a failure to fully activate microglia in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, when platelet-derived growth factor-transformed glial cells were engrafted orthotopically into the mice, the tumors that formed progressed to high grades in wild-type mice but not cyclin D1-deficient animals. Together, our findings establish that the cyclin D1-cdk4 axis is not only critical in glial tumor cells but also in stromal-derived cells in the surrounding tumor microenvironment that are vital to sustain tumor outgrowth.",

Their levels rise upon growth factor stimulation, and they can phosphorylate and thus neutralize Retinoblastoma (Rb) family proteins to promote an E2F-dependent transcriptional program and S-phase entry. Here we characterize the in vivo function of Drosophila Cyclin D (CycD). We find that Drosophila CycD-Cdk4 does not act as a direct G(1)\\/S-phase regulator, but instead promotes cellular growth (accumulation of mass). The cellular response to CycD-Cdk4-driven growth varied according to cell type. In undifferentiated proliferating wing imaginal cells, CycD-Cdk4 caused accelerated cell division (hyperplasia) without affecting cell cycle phasing or cell size. In endoreplicating salivary gland cells, CycD-Cdk4 caused excessive DNA replication and cell enlargement (hypertrophy). In differentiating eyes, CycD-Cdk4 caused cell enlargement (hypertrophy) in post-mitotic cells. Interaction tests with a Drosophila Rb homolog, RBF, indicate that CycD-Cdk4 can counteract the cell cycle suppressive effects of RBF, but that its growth promoting activity is mediated at least in part via other targets.",

This is in part due to inhibition of pRb-directed cdk4 and cdk2 activity. In this study we attempted to elucidate the mechanism by which cdk4 is inactivated under hypoxic conditions. After 18 h of hypoxia, CV-1P cells are inhibited from progressing from G(1) phase into the S phase of the cell cycle. This occurs in conjunction with dephosphorylation of serine-795, which is a putative substrate of cdk4. The amounts of cdk4, cdk6, and the D type cyclins are not affected by 18 h of hypoxia. The levels of cdki p16, p18, p19, and p57 under aerobic or hypoxic conditions were analyzed and although the levels of most cdki are unaffected by hypoxic conditions, the level of p16 increases significantly by 18 h of hypoxia. The mechanism by which cdk4 activity is inhibited under hypoxic conditions may be mediated through p16 association with cdk4. Immunoprecipitation analysis shows that p16 binds to cdk4 under hypoxic conditions but does not in cells maintained under aerobic conditions. Thus p16 may be involved in hypoxia-induced growth inhibition.",

CDK4-cyclin D complexes then persist through the latter phases of the cell cycle, although little is known about their potential roles. We have developed small molecule inhibitors that are highly selective for CDK4 and have used these to define a role for CDK4-cyclin D in G(2) phase. The addition of the CDK4 inhibitor or small interfering RNA knockdown of cyclin D3, the cyclin D partner, delayed progression through G(2) phase and mitosis. The G(2) phase delay was independent of ATM\\/ATR and p38 MAPK but associated with elevated Wee1. The mitotic delay was because of failure of chromosomes to migrate to the metaphase plate. However, cells eventually exited mitosis, with a resultant increase in cells with multiple or micronuclei. Inhibiting CDK4 delayed the expression of the chromosomal passenger proteins survivin and borealin, although this was unlikely to account for the mitotic phenotype. These data provide evidence for a novel function for CDK4-cyclin D3 activity in S and G(2) phase that is critical for G(2)\\/M progression and the fidelity of mitosis.",

Adipose tissue contributes to the development of obesity-related insulin resistance through increased release of fatty acids, altered adipokine secretion, and\\/or macrophage infiltration and cytokine release. Here, we aimed to analyze the participation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) in adipose tissue biology. We determined that white adipose tissue (WAT) from CDK4-deficient mice exhibits impaired lipogenesis and increased lipolysis. Conversely, lipolysis was decreased and lipogenesis was increased in mice expressing a mutant hyperactive form of CDK4 (CDK4(R24C)). A global kinome analysis of CDK4-deficient mice following insulin stimulation revealed that insulin signaling is impaired in these animals. We determined that insulin activates the CCND3-CDK4 complex, which in turn phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) at serine 388, thereby creating a positive feedback loop that maintains adipocyte insulin signaling. Furthermore, we found that CCND3 expression and IRS2 serine 388 phosphorylation are increased in human obese subjects. Together, our results demonstrate that CDK4 is a major regulator of insulin signaling in WAT.",

We report mutation screening of the INK4A and CDK4 genes in 42 UK families. A total of nine families were identified with INK4A mutations and none with CDK4 exon 2 mutations. These mutations were in 8\\/22 (35%) families with three or more cases of melanoma and 1\\/20 (5%) families with only two cases. In one of these nine families a novel single base pair substitution was identified, Gly67Arg.

The p19 gene was sequenced in DNA from the 42 UK families and six additional US families. No mutations were identified.",

Patient age at presentation ranged from 27 to 95 years (median, 54 years), and there was a slight male predilection (male\\/female ratio = 1.2:1). Tumors most frequently involved the lower limb (47% of cases) or upper limb (18%). Other anatomic sites, including trunk (14%), retroperitoneum (7%), head and neck (5%), abdomen\\/pelvis (5%), and spermatic cord (4%), were less frequently involved. Tumor size ranged from 1.5 to 21 cm (median, 8 cm), with deep (subfascial) locations (39 cases) being more frequent than subcutaneous (11 cases) or dermal sites (5 cases). All lesions showed features of pleomorphic sarcoma and at least focally contained typical multivacuolated lipoblasts. Although there was considerable overlap, tumors fell into three broad categories: high-grade pleomorphic\\/spindle cell sarcoma with scattered lipoblasts or sheets of lipoblasts (60%), high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma with epithelioid areas and scattered lipoblasts (28%), and intermediate- to high-grade sarcoma predominantly resembling myxofibrosarcoma except for the presence of lipoblasts (12%). Immunohistochemistry revealed focal staining for smooth muscle actin in 13 of 29 cases (45%), S-100 protein positivity in lipoblasts in 15 of 45 cases (33%), focal staining for keratin in 6 of 28 cases (21%), including 5 of 13 (38%) with epithelioid morphology, and focal staining for desmin in 4 of 30 cases (13%). Follow-up data, available in 50 patients (88%) (median, 33 months), showed local recurrence in 34% of patients, systemic metastases in 32%, and tumor-related death in 32%. Only 2 of the 16 superficial (dermal or subcutaneous) lesions metastasized. Five-year overall, local recurrence-free, metastasis-free, and disease-free survivals were 63%, 58%, 58%, and 39%, respectively. By univariate analysis, central (nonextremity) location, deep situation, tumor size > or =10 cm, mitotic rate > or =10 per 10 HPF, necrosis, and epithelioid morphology were associated with a worse prognosis. However, by multivariate analysis, only age > or =60 years, central location, tumor size, and mitotic rate remained independent predictors for an adverse outcome. By multivariate analysis, wide local excision or amputation and postoperative radiotherapy protected against local recurrence.",

One year earlier, he noticed this swelling, which was slow growing little by little. Palpation revealed a movable mass in right scrotum, 7 x 3 x 3 cm in size and separated from the right testis. Scintigraphy could not show RI accumulation and ultrasonography showed a capsulated homogeneous mass. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed capsulated fat-like almost homogeneous mass, which enclosed the right spermatic cord. This mass was suspected of spermatic cord lipoma or liposarcoma and was removed with radical orchiectomy. The weight of the mass was 246 g. This mass had a bunch of grape appearance and consisted of several masses of various sizes surrounding the spermatic cord, and could be separated from the right epididymis and testis. Histological examination revealed well differentiated liposarcoma and lipoma. Spermatic cord liposarcoma is very rare and this preoperative diagnosis is very difficult. Imaging diagnosis, such as CT, MRI may help our preoperative diagnosis.",

To our knowledge, less than 200 cases worldwide are reported thus far. It is characterized by slow growth and can reach large dimensions at diagnosis. Paratesticular well-differentiated liposarcoma has a prolonged clinical course with recurrences in more than half the cases, sometimes late. Regardless of tumor size, radical orchidectomy with free surgical margins is recommended in order to avoid recurrence. When there is tumor recurrence, reoperation is the treatment of choice because radio- and chemotherapy have yet to be well established in these cases. There is a low risk of metastasis. Overall prognosis is good. Adjuvant therapies, represented by radio- and chemotherapy, have a controversial role in the literature due to the rarity of the disease.

Knockout mouse models have provided insight into the interplay of these Cdks. Most of these models do not exhibit major cell cycle defects revealing redundancies, and suggesting that a single Cdk might be sufficient to drive the cell cycle, similar as in yeast. Recent work on Cdk2\\/Cdk4 double knockouts has indicated that these two Cdks are required to phosphorylate Rb during late embryogenesis. The lack of Rb phosphorylation is progressive and associated with reduced E2F-inducible gene expression. Cdk2 and Cdk4 share the essential function of coupling the G1\\/S transition with mitosis. However, proliferation in early embryogenesis appears to be independent of Cdk2 and Cdk4. We discuss these observations and propose molecular mechanisms that establish the requirement for Cdk2 and Cdk4 at the G1\\/S transition. We are considering that the balance between proliferation and differentiation is disturbed, which affects especially heart development and leads to embryonic lethality in Cdk2-\\/- Cdk4-\\/- mutants. We also discuss the specific functions of Cdk4 and Cdk6, which ironically do not compensate for each other.",

Cell Titer-Glo was used to determine the effects of each of the inhibitors on cellular viability alone and in combination with sunitinib (VEFGR tyrosine kinase inhibitor). The effect of LY2835219 on phosphorylation of BAD, a PIM1 substrate, was assessed by Western blot.PIM1 and dual PIM1-CDK4\\/6 inhibition showed more potent effects on cellular viability than CDK4\\/6 inhibition. ED50 values of each inhibitor for RCC cells are reported in Table 1. Further assays showed greater decreased cellular viability in cells treated with the combination of a PIM1 inhibitor and sunitinib than in cells treated with either a PIM1 inhibitor or sunitinib alone. When combined with sunitinib, dual PIM1-CDK4\\/6 inhibition was more effective than PIM1 inhibition in 786-O cells. Sunitinib in combination with a CDK4\\/6 inhibitor was not as effective as in combination with either a PIM1 inhibitor or a dual PIM1-CDK4\\/6 inhibitor. Western blot analysis showed a decrease in phospho-BAD in cells treated with a dual PIM1-CDK4\\/6 inhibitor.Potency of Kinase Inhibitors Against RCC Cell LinesOur data reveal that targeting PIM1 in combination with sunitinib is superior to sunitinib alone in RCC cell lines. Additionally, in 786-O cells, added CDK4\\/6 inhibition further improves the efficacy of the combination therapy. Dual PIM1-CDK4\\/6 kinase targeted therapy in combination with sunitinib is an attractive therapeutic regimen with good potential for translation to the clinic. Ongoing studies include further characterization of the molecular events involved including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, PIM1 kinase and CDK4\\/6 kinase activity, and evaluation of the combination therapy in a mouse xenograft model of RCC."

In primary epidermal cells, we found that oncogenic Ras transiently decreases cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 expression in association with cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. CDK4 co-expression circumvents Ras growth suppression and induces invasive human neoplasia resembling squamous cell carcinoma. Tumorigenesis is dependent on CDK4 kinase function, with cyclin D1 required but not sufficient for this process. In facilitating escape from G1 growth restraints, Ras and CDK4 alter the composition of cyclin D and cyclin E complexes and promote resistance to growth inhibition by INK4 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. These data identify a new role for oncogenic Ras in CDK4 regulation and highlight the functional importance of CDK4 suppression in preventing uncontrolled growth.",

It is not known, however, how much of a round cell component within an otherwise typical myxoid liposarcoma results in a neoplasm that behaves as a high-grade sarcoma. Twenty-nine cases of myxoid liposarcoma of the extremities with or without a component of round cell liposarcoma were studied to semiquantitate the amount of round cell component needed to adversely affect prognosis. An estimate of the percent of necrosis, round cell liposarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, and transitional areas was obtained for each slide on all cases. Transitional areas were defined as those that displayed an increased cellularity compared with typical myxoid liposarcoma, but in which the cells remained spindled, did not have overlapping nuclear borders, and retained an easily discernible plexiform vascular pattern. The amount of necrosis was subtracted from the total material available for evaluation, and a composite estimate of the percent of round cell, myxoid, and transitional areas was obtained. Two tumors were located on the upper extremity, 27 on the lower extremity; tumor size ranged frm 3 to 30 cm (median, 14 cm). All 29 tumors had a myxoid component, with a range from 12 to 100% (median, 73%). The range of transitional component for all 29 tumors was 0 to 88% (median, 11%). Twenty-one tumors had transitional areas (range, 4-88%). The range of round cell component for all 29 tumors was 0 to 58% (median, 0%). Twelve tumors had round cell areas (range, 1-58%). Seventeen patients are either alive without disease, or died from unrelated causes at 24-202 months (median, 96 months). Twelve patients are either alive with metastases or died of disease at 10 to 180 months (median, 53 months). Patients with > 5% round cell component in their initial tumor had a statistically significant higher rate of metastasis or death due to disease than those with < or = 5% round cell liposarcoma (p = 0.05). In addition, patients with myxoid liposarcoma with transitional areas did not fare worse than those with myxoid liposarcoma alone. In conclusion, we found that a round cell component of > 5% portends a higher risk of metastasis or death from disease. Furthermore, transitional areas alone do not appear to alter the prognosis of myxoid liposarcoma. Thus, only those areas that are unequivocally round cell liposarcoma should be designated as high grade.",

A 28-year old man presented with a painful skin colored subcutaneous mass on his left flank. The skin lesion was discovered about two months ago. Computed tomography revealed a well-defined tumor in the subcutaneous area without significant lymphadenopathy. A histopathologic study showed a nonencapsulated nodular growing tumor mass under the deep dermis composed of a mixture of atypical proliferating lipoblasts in a prominent myxoid stroma, occasional uniform round to oval shaped primitive nonlipogenic mesenchymal cells and plexiform, chicken wire shaped capillaries. Based on these findings, we diagnosed this case as myxoid and round cell liposarcoma. Because liposarcomas are large tumors of the deep subcutis or deeper soft tissue, they rarely come to the attention of the dermatologist. However, liposarcoma should be of concern, especially when rapid growing subcutaneous tumors are shown.",
